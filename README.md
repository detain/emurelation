# Emu⬅re➡lation
Emu⬅re➡lation is project with 1 simple purpose; to provide a mapping in JSON format of platforms accross different sources.  There are several varied naming conventions used and many different programs and sites and this aims to allow you an easy way to convert or map the data from one type to another.  It will eventually expand to include emulators, games, etc; but for now the initial focus is simply platform matching accross all sources.
