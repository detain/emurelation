        "description": "This early japanese computer seems quite strong with its metal case. The machine has a very sober look. The keyboard is minimalist too, no CTRL or ESC keys...\nThere is apparently no graphical high-resolution but the computer offers 253 predefined characters including graphic symbols.\nThe power switch is placed on the front case just above the keyboard.\nThe MB6880 formal name was \"Basic Master\" but it was called as \"Basic Master Level 1\" after MB-6880L2 \"Basic Master Level 2\" was released.\nBasic Master Level 1 was shipped with 4KB RAM with Level 1 BASIC language that only integer value supported.\nBasic Master Level 2  was shipped with 8KB RAM with Level 2 BASIC that support floating value.\nThese product line made great success at the beginning of Japanese microcomputer market. By the success of Basic Master serie, the three company - Hitachi, NEC and Sharp -were called \"The Big Three\".\nHitachi continued to release variation of Basic Master Level2 series such as MB6881(Basic Master Level II 2) and the MB6885  (Basic Master Jr).\nHowever  \"Basic Master Level 2\" series lacked Hi-resolution graphics or Kanji characters.  Hitachi's microcomputer continued to decline until Basic Master Level 3 was released.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Hisayuki Nomura for the info<\/font>",

        "description": "The <b>Thomson TO 7<\/b> is the first micro computer conceived by Thomson and the first French micro-computer. This computer, also called <b>Thomson 9000<\/b> was mainly used in french schools and had somehow a great success in France. \"TO\" stands for \"Tele Ordinateur\" (ordinateur meaning computer in French).\nOne of the most interesting feature of the TO-7 is its light pen. Indeed, there is one stored in a small trap above the keyboard. A wide range of software used this device. Even on later Thomson systems (MO and TO series), the light pen is still available as an option. It was the distinctive sign of the Thomson micro-computers.\nOn the other hand, its flat membrane keyboard (like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">ZX 81<\/a>'s one) is awful! It is impossible to type something quickly. Each stroke is signaled by a small beep. There is a key labeled RAZ (Remise A Zero) which clears the screen, like the classic CLS command... There is a also a ACC key (Accent) which enables accentuated letters.\nWhen you switch on the computer, there is no language, just a small configuration tool to test the light pen. The Basic 1.0 (Microsoft Basic 5) is delivered on a cartridge. It inserts into the cartridge trap door on the left side of the keyboard. The cartridges are called \"Memo 7\". Sadly, the trap door locking system is not very secure, and all TO 7 owners experienced the lost of their programs when the trap door opened itself without prompting... When the trap door opens, the cartridge is ejected, and the system hangs. You've lost everything :(\nThe Basic is quite complete with useful statements. To do graphics you've got LINE (to draw a line), PSET (to draw points), BOX (to draw a box) and BOXF (to draw a filled box). You can also handle the lightpen with INPEN, INPUTPEN, PEN and ONPEN. The joystick states are read with STICK and STRIG. To do music, you have the PLAY statement, which has been Frenchised. To play the standard note sequence, you would type: PLAY \"DOREMIFASOLASI\"...\nAt the back of the computer, one can find 4 expansion slots protected by plastic caps. Three are identical and are used for common expansions like joystick, disk-drives, etc. The fourth one is used by the optional memory expansion. Another item you can't miss at the back of the TO 7 is the BIG heatsink! This thing is huge and was known to cut a lot :( So be careful when you handle a TO 7! It also gets hot fairly quickly, so don't get burn either (man, the TO 7 is dangerous!).\nThe first programs (mainly developped by Vifi-Nathan) where really bad, often written in Basic. They were essentialy boring educative games. Despite this bad point, the TO-7 did well thanks to the French National Education who bought a lot of systems to the nationalised Thomson company... And in 1984, the TO-7 was replaced with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=643\">TO-7\/70<\/a> (in fact the TO-7 continued to be sold too for a short time) which corrected the main weaknesses of its little brother.",

        "description": "The MO-5 was presented alongside the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=643\">TO 7\/70<\/a>, in march 1984. While the TO-7\/70 follows and enhances the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=11\">TO-7<\/a> philosophy, the MO-5 is more a cut-down version of the TO-7\/70. The idea was to design a coherent french home computer, able to compete with such systems as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX Spectrum<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a>.\nThe case of the MO-5 is elegant with its anthracit colour and pleasant lines. The keyboard, though made of rubber keys, is an improvement over the flat membrane keyboard of the TO-7. Most BASIC statements are engraved onto the keys and can be directly entered by pressing a special BASIC key and the key matching the desire statement. But the Basic commands can also be typed in letter by letter. The keyboard layout is AZERTY which is normal as the MO-5 is a french system. Accentuated letters can directly be accessed by pressing the ACC key, followed by the desired key (6 for ?, 7 for ?, 8 for ?, 9 for ? and 0 for ?). There are also four arrow keys, INS to insert a space, EFF to delete the pointed character, STOP to pause a program, CNT to resume a program stoped and RAZ (remise ? z?ro) to clear the screen.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=12\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Laser 128 EX is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=156\">Laser 3000<\/a>. Like the 3000, it is fully compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II computer<\/a>, but has enhanced features.\nVideo Technology designed its own Apple II compatible ROM (Apple lost a lawsuit challenging it), this ROM holds an Applesoft compatible version of the BASIC.\nThe \"Open Apple\" and \"Closed Apple\" keys have been replaced with \"Open Triangle\" and \"Closed Triangle\" keys.\nThe 128EX\/2's Video Display Generator chip also provided both analog RGB video (for connecting an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=71\">Apple IIGS<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a>, or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari ST<\/a> monitor) and digital RGB video (for connecting a CGA monitor).  In RGB mode, the Video Display Generator (VDG) chip generates a text character set identical to an IBM PC (with the addition of the Open and Closed Triangle characters)\nThe drive and the external daisy-chainable SmartPort floppy drive is driven by Video Technologies custom \"Universal Disk Controller\" (UDC) disk array chip. The SmartPort supports Apple <a href=\"computer.asp?c=83\">IIe<\/a>\/<a href=\"computer.asp?c=69\">IIc<\/a> UniDisks (3.5\" and 5.25\" models), <a href=\"computer.asp?c=271\">Macintosh<\/a> 3.5\" drives (the ones without the buttons), Apple IIGS daisy-chainable 3.5\" drives and Apple 5.25\" disks. It is also designed to support the Chinook CT-series 20 MB to 100 MB SmartPort hard drives. The SmartPort can support two 800K 3.5\" drives, two 140K 5.25\" drives, and one 100 MB CT100 hard drive simultaneously daisy-chained to each other.\nThe  Apple bus compatible expansion slot can hold an Apple High Speed (DMA) SCSI controller for running additional SCSI based storage devices.\nThis unit was so successful that Apple Computers was prompted to upgrade the IIc to counter it. The result was the Apple IIc Plus, also released in 1988. The IIc Plus had a 4 Mhz Western Design Center 65C02 processor, an 800K 3.5\" drive built-in, and an External Drive \"SmartPort\" capable of the same tricks as the Laser's.\nAlthough the two units were similarly matched, Video Technology actively advertised the Laser 128EX\/2 while Apple had moved on to promoting the Macintosh.\nThe Laser became the most successful Apple II clone ever and this model was 99.8% IIc Plus compatible. The only two pieces of software the Apple magazines reported as incompatible were The New Print Shop (Br?derbund Software) and HomeWord (Sierra).\nIn North America, the Laser was aggressively marketed in Sears department stores, where it eroded its niche rival's sales, the Commodore 128.\nThis Laser unit's case was also used to make a Turbo XT PC clone. The PC clone and the Laser 128EX\/2 shared the same case. They looked identical except for the label. Instead of \"Laser 128EX\/2,\" the XT had \"Laser XT10\"\nLater, Video Technology also had a line of PC machines ranging from an XT 10 MHz, three 80286 versions, a failed 386 and a very robust but expensive 486 before they stopped making them and went back to electronic toys.",

        "description": "The \"best of both worlds\". The Xerox 8 \/ 16 belongs to a family which appeared at the end of the 8 bit era, when MS-DOS began to be a standard for the 16-bit systems. It has two CPUs, the Z80 allows the use of CP\/M and the 8086 is for MS DOS and CP\/M 86. This computer was actually two computers sharing certain resources, like the display, the power supply and the floppies but essentially seperate.\nThis computer was one of the first, if not the first PC-sized computer that had concurrent processing (not time share, but real honest to goodness concurrent processing). One could start a task on either operating system, say a spread sheet, and then hot key over to the other processor and perform another task, all while the other \"side\" was working at full speed at it's task. Because the 16\/8 was actually two computers in one, both sides worked at full capacity and did not share ram or other system resources required for processing data: they worked at full speed regardless of whether or not the other side was in use. Only the \"active side\" had access to the video, floppies and the hard drive (if avaialble), but with dual floppies, one floppy could be assigned for the 8 bit side and one for the 16 bit side. In that instance, each side would access the its assigned floppy when brought to the active side. \nThe 16\/8 is made of four units :\n- a 12'' monochrom monitor, housing the whole hardware of the system, like in the Apple Macintosh,\n- the keyboard, very complete,\n- the disks (two 5''1\/4 disks, a hard-disk (5 MB, later 10 MB) was optional),\n- an expansion box meant to house the different expansion boards.\nThere was also a Diablo printer in option. The whole system thus took quite some room on your desktop!\nAfter the presentation of the first 16\/8 in 1983, Xerox launched a new version in 1984, faster, more compact and sold with a hard-disk.\nUnfortunately the 16\/8 was a bit obsolete as the 8-bit professional systems were dying slowly and the 16\/8 wasn't offering much more than an IBM PC launched a few years before. The price of the system wasn't even attractive.\nXerox stopped the production of all its micro-computers at the start of the year 1985.\nThis computer is the direct successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=15\">Xerox 820 series<\/a>, which could be almost converted into a Xerox 8\/16 with a special 8086 board.\n<b>Dale Carpenter<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nSeveral things, an 820-II has an extra expansion slot on the motherboard. if you put the 16-bit card into that slot your 820-II is now a 16\/8.\nYour picture shows a rectangular box called an EM-II (expansion module - II) to add it to a 16\/8 you remove the 16-bit card and install it in the card cage in the center of the EM-II then install the card with 2 wide ribbon cables attached(coming from the EM-II) into the expansion slot on the motherboard.\nThe EM-II has either 1 hard drive, 1 floppy or 1 of each. The system supported the external drives also, the dual 5.25\" and 8\" boxes.\nOne final note not mentioned: all of the 8\" drive boxes had an expansion plug on the back you could daisey chain up to 4 drive units onto any of the 820, 820-II and 16\/8 machines.<\/font>\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to chrism3667 for the picture<\/font>",

Is so they were discontinued because of the excessive radio noise that they put out.\nHowever, the Model 3 wasn't FULLY compatible with the model 1.  There were differences in ROM which meant some programs had to be converted, especially those machine language ones that made ROM calls.\n______________________\nModel III configurations, by <b>Dave Thompson<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">TRS-80 Model III was sold in multiple configurations.\nNo hardrive configurations included:\nModel III with Level 1 ROM, 8k RAM sold for US$799.  Model III with Level 2 ROM, 16k RAM sold for $999.\n  \nThe first floppy drive cost $849, and could store 168k. The second drive was cheaper, and could store more. The price difference is due to the first one included the drive controller. The increased space on the second drive (189k) was due to the first drive must also contain some TRS-DOS (the operating system).<\/font>\n<b>Brandt Daniels<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere was also a TRS-80 VideoTex Computer terminal in 1980.<\/font>\n<b>Mark Fowler<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I worked for a company in 1982 that had integrated a 5MB, and later a 10MB hard disk into the TRS80 Model III.

As the PC 1512, the Amstrad PC 1640 came with the GEM graphical user interface, from Digital Research, an alternative to Windows.\nThe PC-1640 was marketed under the name PC-6400 in the USA. It was also sold in Germany and maybe some other European countries under the name Schneider. \nThree different kinds of monitors where supported, monochrome (-&gt; Hercules), low-res (max 640 x 200) and hi-res (max 640 x 350). The hi-res monitor had a fan for the power supply as opposed to the other monitors which where fan-less. With the low-res monitor you could choose between a full CGA compatible mode (required for many CGA games) and an EGA mode (used for 640 x 200 x 16 eg. for GEM or 320 x 200 x 16 for several games).\n________\nContributors: Andr?

All of this proved to come from IBM itself, which made Alan Sugar really angry).\nYou can find all this info in 'Alan Sugar' from late D. Thomas.<\/font>\n<b>Ex Cathedra's<\/b> memories:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI did a large amount of development on these machines in the late 80s. They were surprisingly good, with only a few bugs and incompatibilities with the IBM PC standard. Bearing in mind the price differential, we had no problems living with these.\nThe RTC and BIOS settings were preserved by 4xAA batteries under the monitor - a configuration I wish we still had today! There was a minor (patchable) bug in the BIOS which caused a div\/0 error at midnight each night if you'd left it running a long compilation...<\/font>",

In fact, the Atari 520ST originaly came with the OS on floppy as the OS was not completly finished.  Very shortly afterward they came with the OS on 6 ROM chips (TOS 1.0).\n \nIt was first sold in Germany where it met a great success then released in the United States about six monts later. Colour and monochrome version were available. Sadly, users of the colour version couldn't expect programs written for the monochrome version to work until someone wrote an emulator allowing the software written for the monochrome version to run on a colour monitor.\nAtari was the first company to offer built-in MIDI ports.  This made the computer very popular with musicians.  One game even used the MIDI conectors (Midi Maze) to connect up to 16 computers together in a MIDI network.\nThe <b>520 ST+<\/b> offered 1 MB of RAM instead of 512 KB. As the main board was designed to provide space for only 512 KB of RAM (16 x 41256 type chips), the second 512 KB bank chips were soldered on top of the original chips.\nApparently, 1 Mb versions were sold as Atari 1040s in Australia...\nThe model <b>520 STM<\/b> came with a built-in TV modulator allowing a direct connection with the TV-set. \nThe original Atari 520 ST came with an external  360K single sided 3.5 floppy drive, the SF354.

        "description": "The Atari STe is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=25\">Atari STf<\/a> (The 'e' stands for 'enhanced') and is almost fully compatible with the STf.\nIn september 1986, Atari decided to make a successor to the STf. They planned to equip it with enhanced video features : Atari said then that the STe will have a 640 x 400 with 16 colors among 4096 and a 320 x 200 with 256 colors among 4096 graphic modes. Unfortunately, eventually, the STe will have none of these graphic modes.\nThe new features are :\n- a new version of the OS (\"Rainbow\" TOS 1.6 and later, 1.62),\n- a Blitter chip to quick perform memory moves (it is the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=165\">the Mega STf<\/a> one),\n- the video chip (Shifter) has been enhanced: the STe can perform, as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a>, hardware scrolling in all directions and it is possible to write into the video counters. It also handle 4096 colors instead of 512, unfortunately, it can only display a maximum of 16 of them (without trick).\n- 'phase lock' of the video output to an external video source permitting direct linking to genlocking device.\n- It has enhanced sound features too: two 8 bit PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation) channels which can replay stereo sound at 6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50 KHz and which can be mixed with the 3 FM channels.\nDespite its new and interesting features, the Atari STe was a flop in the marketplace. The STf market was too important and the software editors (especially game editors) didn't sell STe versions of their products.\nNot long after this, Atari launched the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=164\">Mega STe<\/a> to replace the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=165\">Mega STf<\/a>.\nThere was an interesting variation on the STe in the R&amp;D labs of Atari, called the STe+, which had an AMD 286 chip and a small IDE hard drive built in.  Quite why this was abandoned nobody really knows, but a number of working prototypes were found in Atari's Mexico office when Atari finally blinked out of existence and have appeared on ebay from time to time.\n_______________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Malcolm Ramage.<\/font>",

Amstrad tried to prolong the life of the old 8-bit Amstrads, which suffered from competition with the new 16-bit home computers (like the Amiga and Atari ST).\nAmstrad made some important modifications to maintain the level of its machines, the CPC 6128 Plus became 95% compatible with the CPC 6128 (using the same operating systems AMSDOS and CP\/M 3.0). However, some software did not run on the plus range and amstrad official statement was that the programmers where lazy and used bad programming in some software resulting in crashes on this machine.\nSeveral new features were added: hardware scrolling, increased color palette, an enhanced sound chip, a cartridge port, and a redesigned keyboard. Some of these features were not even present (yet) on certain 16-bit computers (Atari STf didn't have hardware scrolling or sprites). Regardless, this new version of the CPC didn't last long. \nThe system offers 16 hardware sprites at a size of 16x16 pixels. The sprites are using 15 other colors than the 16 of the palette, and have x\/y zoom. The soundchip is the same AY as on the CPC, but controlable with a DMA.\nAs Atari did with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=21\">65-XE<\/a> when it reached the end of its life, so Amstrad  made a game console from the Amstrad CPC Plus hardware called the GX 4000.

        "description": "The inventor of the Amiga 1000 was <b>Jay Miner<\/b>, who created the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=76\">Atari 800<\/a> many years before. He wanted to make the most powerful computer ever, then he joined a small Californian company called Amiga. He used the principle of the three coprocessors (again) to help the main processor.\nAt the beginning, the Amiga had only 64 kilobytes of RAM! The original \"Amiga\" called the Lorraine was meant to be a game machine with some computer capabilities.\nAtari initially invested the money in the Amiga Corp. to do the R&amp;D on the Amiga computer line.  Naturally, when the design was finished, Amiga Corp. gave Atari the choice to purchase the technology.  Atari passed in favor of their own project. Amiga Corp. then offered the technology to Commodore, Inc., who were quite pleased to purchase it, seeing that their own 16-bit computer was so far from reaching the shelf.\nAfter the loss of a major legal battle for control of the Amiga chip set design, Atari launched the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">ST<\/a> series (Sixteen-Thirty-two)  as a competitor for the upcoming Amiga.\nThe operating system (AmigaDOS) was done by MetaComCo, a British company who specialized in the 68000 processor (they also made languages for the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=199\">Sinclair QL<\/a>). It is a fully multitasking system which looks like UNIX with a graphical user interface.\nIt was the very first personal computer with great graphics and sound capabilities with a GUI environment.\nThe Amiga BASIC was written by Microsoft (like most other versions of BASIC), but the first models were shipped with a non-Microsoft BASIC called ABasiC.\nThe Amiga 1000 was to lose popularity one year later with the creation of its two main successors: the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=65\">Amiga 500<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=63\">Amiga 2000<\/a>.\nThere were two versions of the Amiga 1000. The first one sold only in the USA, had a NTSC display and no EHB video mode. Later versions would have this built in. The second one had a PAL display, the enhanced video modes (EHB) and was built in Germany.\nThe official name for the A1000 was the Commodore Amiga. It was only when the A2000 was launched that they officially began to refer to the machine by its model number.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=28\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was a very popular computer in the UK and was widely used in schools, but it didn't have great success elsewhere (even though it did have great features, it was too expensive). \nThe <b>Model A<\/b> lacked some of the connectors of the <b>Model B\/B+<\/b> (User port, Tube, ...) on the underside.\nThis computer got its name because in 1980, the BBC decided to start a computer literacy television series. The network realized that, with more powerful and increasingly inexpensive microcomputers, it would soon be possible to create them with enough computing power to offer their owners personal hands-on experience with microcomputers at an affordable price. \nThe BBC considered the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=176\">NewBrain<\/a> computer and rejected it. Acorn and Sinclair Research, along with other companies, then submitted designs, and Acorn won. The BBC model B was then used almost universally in British schools from its birth into the 90's. \nIt was followed in 1982 by the Acorn <b>BBC model B<\/b>. The Model B had the same features but had 32 KB RAM (expandable to 64K).\nThe \"Tube\" was an expansion port which was designed to connect other processors to the BBC (6502, Z80, 68000 or ARM 1 RISC). An interface card was specially designed for the tube. It used another 6502 and a Z80.\nOne of its most popular peripherals was the \"Torch\" floppy disk unit, a 5.25\" floppy disk drive with a Z80 which allowed the BBC to use CP\/M software. \nAcorn also made a \"cheap\" version of the BBC (fewer connectors &amp; video modes) called <a href=\"computer.asp?c=121\">Acorn Electron<\/a>.\nIn 1985, the Acorn <b>BBC Model B+<\/b> was released. The Model B+ had new features : 64K of RAM instead of 32 KB and internal circuitry for the Econet and Disk Drive as standard (both available as an upgrade in the models A and B). The later models included disk support as standard, using either an 8271 or a 1770 disk controller. There was also a B+ 128KB model (with and extra 4x16KB banks of \"sideways RAM\"). The B+ models had 48KB of ROM because they had an extra 16KB with the DFS. They used a MOS 6512A processor, but at the same 2MHz that the A and B models used.\nIt was then followed by the BBC Master.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Gabriel Gra?a<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=29\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was replaced three years later with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=32\">Amiga 4000<\/a>. \n<a href=\"http:\/\/amiga.emugaming.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amiga Interactive Guide<\/a> description :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The A3000 is a powerhouse in comparison to previous Amiga, it was sold as a high-end graphics workstation. For a time it was used by W Industries as the basis of their highly acclaimed Virtuality machines. At the heart of the A3000 was the powerful 68030 (described in ST\/Amiga Format as a 'as a mainframe on a chip'). In addition the A3000 was the first Amiga to feature the new Kickstart 2 upgrade and Zorro III slots. \nTo emphasis the A3000s capabilities as a high-end workstation, two operating systems were included: \nThe first was the newly released Kickstart\/Workbench 2. This was unusual by the fact that Kickstart was stored on the hard disk rather than in ROM. This was similar to the A1000 that required Kickstart to be loaded from floppy disk before anything else could be done. \nThe second OS to be included with the A3000 was the Unix System (SVR4) V operating system. This allowed the use of the Unix graphical interface, X Windows and Open Look. It also came with standard networking capabilities (probably a first for Commodore), such as TCP\/IP, NFS and RFS for networking between different operating systems. In a bizarre twist, the Unix OS was sold on a magnetic tape rather than floppy disk. \n<\/font>\nThree Amiga 3000 models were produced : 3000, 3000UX, and 3000T.\nThe <b>3000<\/b> was the desktop model (pictured here) which shipped with flippable 1.3 or 2.0 AmigaOS Roms. The <b>Amiga 3000T<\/b>, released in 1991, was a tower system with built-in speaker, 32Mb RAM, high-resolution mouse, 100 Mb hard-drive, a lot of Zorro II slots, a variety of drive bays, and a 25Mhz 68030 with a 68882 math coprocessor. The <b>3000UX<\/b> shipped with \"AMIX\", Commodore's System-5 derived UNIX which was very nice and came with X-windows. It was Commodore's only serious attempt to get into the UNIX workstation market, and a noble effort that unfortunately failed utterly.\nNotice there are some rare versions of the Amiga 3000: the <b>3000\/16<\/b> (the speed is only 16 MHz) and the <b>Amiga 3000+<\/b> which uses an AGA video chip and a DSP. The 3000+ was a prototype only. A few units are known to exist, but they are not supported. The DSP was able to function as a software modem in some configurations, which was extremely cool.",

        "description": "In 1992 Commodore launched the most advanced Amiga yet. The A4000 used the AGA chipset to allow it to show 256,000 colours on screen from a palette of 16.8 million, as well as the new Workbench 3 that introduced the concept of among other things, datatypes. The Amiga 4000 is one of the most powerful Amigas ever made.\n \nAs a replacement for the A3000 &amp; A3000T, the A4000 was a combination of the A2000 (big box), A3000 (vertical slots (integrated hard drive controller) and A1200 (AGA chips). As standard it allows memory expansion for up to 18Mb RAM on the motherboard. It shipped with either a 25 MHz 68030\/68882 or 25 MHz 68040 CPU. The A4000 was never intended for release, but was a prototype for a system known as the A3000 Plus which was a considerably better machine. The machine was eventually cancelled and the A4000 drafted for release due to the low cost of development. \nLike the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=30\">Amiga 3000<\/a>, the 4000 has 2 MB of chip RAM (reserved for its coprocessors) and 4 MB of fast RAM (used directly by the 68040).\nThe Amiga 4000 mainboard was planned to use the AAA chip (the video custom chip designed to replace the AGA chip), the AAA chip was theoretically designed to use 8 MB FastRAM (see the \"Chip RAM : ON=2MB, OFF=8MB\" jumper on the motherboard), unfortunately, Commodore didn't use this chip, so this jumper is absolutely useless. \nThere's an internal 120 MB IDE hard disk and 4 expansion slots: three ISA slots (for PC compatible cards) and one dedicated 32 bit video slot used for graphics cards.\nThe Amiga 4000 works under WorKBench 3.0, a very powerful and flexible multitasking system which looks like UNIX, it can read &amp; write directly to DOS 1.44 Mb floppy disks.\nThe Amiga 4000 was mainly used for video production but was in direct competition with the PC compatibles when most of its major products (ImageIn, Real 3D, &amp; Lightwave, to name a few) were adapted for Windows.\nThere were in fact two models of Amiga 4000 :\n- the <b>A4000-040<\/b> released in September 92 with a Motorola 68040 Processor, 6 Mb RAM, internal 3.5\" 1.76 Mb Floppy Drive and 120 Mb IDE Hard Drive,\n- and the <b>A4000-030<\/b> released March 93, with Motorola 25MHz 68030EC processor, 4Mb RAM (2Mb Chip, 2Mb Fast), 3.5\" FDD, 120Mb hard disk, etc.\nThere was even a more powerful successor called <b>Amiga 4000T<\/b> (\"T\" stands for Tower). The A4000T is basically an A4000 in a full tower case with IDE &amp; SCSI-2 Fast controllers integrated as well as 2 video slots and shipped with a 25MHz 68040 processor.\nA lot of expansion hardware has been developed for the 4000\/1200 : Video cards (2000 x 1500 in 24 bit), 3D cards, Wide SCSI controllers and PowerPC 604e\/233 MHz accelerator cards.\nThe Amiga scene is still very active and great software is still being developed.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/amiga.emugaming.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amiga Interactive Guide<\/a><\/font>.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Todd Deery<\/b> reports:\nThere was at least one other version of the Amiga 4000 available (at least in Canada) -- the Amiga 4000LC.  This version contained the 25Mhz LC version of the 68040, which lacked a math coprocessor.<\/font>\nfrom <b>Chris Coulson<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nHere in the UK, the 4000-030 (not sure if this is true for the -040 as well) was also available with an 80MB HD in place of the 120MB drive.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Spectrum 128 (code named Derby) is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Spectrum +<\/a>. It was made just before Amstrad bought the right to use the Sinclair name in computer products. So it can be regarded as the last \"real Sinclair Spectrum\".\nThe 128 is the first real evolution of the old <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Spectrum<\/a>. It has a lot of new features: 128kb RAM, a new sound chip (Yamaha AY-3-8912), RS232\/Midi and video RGB outputs.\nThe Spectrum displays a menu when it is switched on: \n- \"Tape Loader\" to run programs on tape,\n- \"Calculator\" to enter operations without typing PRINT before,\n- \"Tape Tester\" to test the input level of the tape recorder,\n- \"BASIC 48\" and \"BASIC 128\".\nThe Spectrum 128 can use two versions of BASIC: BASIC 48 is just for the compatibility with the previous models and can't use the new features.\nThe Basic 128 mode has  a full screen editor and the user can enter the Basic statements letter by letter instead of pressing key combinations. It has new keywords to use the extended memory as a RAM disk (unless bank-switching routines are utilized) and to handle the new sound chip and the MIDI out socket.\nBecause there were still large unsold stocks of Spectrum+ in the UK, the Spectrum 128 was first launched in Spain where the Speccy was already very popular. It was sold there with an external numeric keypad to connect the main unit. This \"spanish model\" doesn't boot on a \"start menu\" as the UK version does (thus spanish 128k models are slightly different than later UK models). But even after being introduced in UK it had a short market life and was replaced with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=221\">Spectrum +2<\/a>.",

The retrofitting is evident in the design of the motherboard.  The motherboard runs at 1Mhz, unlike the Laser 128EX\/2.  In order to run its programs faster, Apple used a 4Mhz 65C02 with 8k of high speed SRAM cache and licensed the accelerator design from Zip Technologies (makers of the ZipChip accelerator for the IIe and IIc).  They built an accelerator into a 1Mhz motherboard rather than designing a faster motherboard from scratch.\nThe designers of the Apple IIc Plus originally wanted to make a portable <a href=\"computer.asp?c=71\">IIGS<\/a>.   Apple's management, bent on promoting the Mac, balked at the idea.  At the same time, the Laser 128EX\/2 made a quick design cycle mandatory.  The result was an updated IIc.\nThe Apple IIc Plus was the finest Apple 8-bit computer ever built, but due to a lack of marketing, the apparent backward step in technology compared to the 16-bit <a href=\"computer.asp?c=71\">Apple IIGS<\/a>, and the aggressive sales of the Laser 128EX\/2, the IIc Plus also was to be the most short-lived of the Apple II models. \n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Steve<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/oldcomputers.net\/\">site<\/a> for the picture.<\/font>",

        "description": "In August 1978, first units of the \"Advanced Basic Computer for the 1980s\", in short ABC-80 left the Swedish Luxor factory. \nA few months earlier, Luxor contracted with two other companies, Scandia Metric and Data Industrier AB (DIAB), to build the first totally Swedish computer. Scandia Metrics which had previous experience of computer based products designed the main board, DIAB manufactured the chips, while Luxor, one of the biggest TV set manufacturers, built the monitor, case and keyboard and assembled the whole system in its assembly plant of Motala (Sweden, at the northeast shore of Swedens second largest sea, V?ttern). \nDespite the fact that the technology behind the ABC 80 was very simple and technical features wasn't better than US competitors, the ABC80 was a quality machine and became a great success among early Swedish computer enthusiasts, who had been waiting for a long time a real local computer. More than 10.000 computers were sold within two years. For six years, the ABC80 and then its sequel the ABC800, were by far the most sold and used personal computers in Sweden, for home, hobby, and especially education. \nMany schools in Sweden had ABC 80 or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=357\">ABC 800<\/a> for the students. It was possible to connect together several ABC 80 thanks to a network called ABC NET.\nIn 1984, the ABC1600 and ABC9000, two Unix systems, were launched with the slogan \"Who needs to be IBM compatible?\"... They were the last Luxor computers produced.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=37\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "This computer was used in the 80's in Hungarian schools along with the Primo. It was very similar to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=153\">Enterprise 64<\/a> as it was a licensed product. There is even a built-in joystick on the right of the keyboard.\nThere are different models : 32 KB, 64 KB and 64 KB+ (picture here). The 64 KB+ has more video RAM (64 KB instead of 16 KB) and different versions of ROM (2.1 - 2.2 &amp; 2.4 instead of 1.1 -1.2 - 1.3 &amp; 1.4).\nThe main physical difference of the TV-Computer is the four expansion slots that are placed at the top left side of the case, allowing easy upgrade of the system. On the left side, one can find two joystick connectors and a cartridge slot (16 KB max.) for games, applications and operating systems. TVC OS is built-in the system (along with Basic), but UPM (special version of CP\/M for the TVC) or VT-DOS (DOS 3.10 compatible) could be implemented this way. VT-DOS could only read\/write IBM PC disks, as it was not fully compatible with both the hardware and software.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Gabor Monok<\/b> for all the info &amp; pictures!<\/font>",

It was intended to be Commodore?s low-end offering ($150-180), whereas the C64 was envisioned as a high-end product ($595).\nThe system was very inexpensive and lacked even basic features such a user expansion port.  In reality, the MAX was a severely limited C64.  Several MAX software titles could actually be run on the C64.\nSome production models used the same video chip as the C64, while others used a 6566 (the NTSC C64 uses the 6567; the PAL C64 uses a 6569).  Regardless of video chip, both variants offered only a single graphics resolution of 320x200 and could not utilize the ?multi-color? functions available on the C64 (unless you set bit 4 in $D016 in MAX BASIC).  The SID sound chip is identical to the one found in its C64 cousin.  BASIC was stored on cartridge rather than in ROM.\nThough initially planned for world-wide release, the Commodore MAX was sold primarily in Japan.  It was advertised in North America under the name <b>ULTIMAX<\/b>, as well as in Germany under the name <b>VC-10<\/b>. \n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Dr IDO<\/b> for some information.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Horizon was a S-100 bus based system. It was the first floppy-disc based system hobbyists could buy. In a case with a choice of wood or blue metal cover, the basic version included a 4 Mhz. Z80 microprocessor, 16 KB of RAM, a 90 KB 5''1\/4 floppy drive with a controller card, a serial terminal interface and 12 S-100 slots. It was sold with the North Star Disc Operating System and a Basic interpreter allowing random and sequential disk files. The Horizon-2 version offered a second floppy-disc drive.\nAny S-100 cards (compatible with Altair, Cromemco and many other systems) could be added to the system, but North Star provided its own additional 16 KB RAM and hardware floating point boards.\nIn 1979, original 90 KB floppy drives were replaced by Shugart 360 KB models. Northstar also offered an add-on box with two additional floppies, making a total of 4. The box had a matching walnut stained plywood cover.",

        "description": "The Polymorphic System 8813 was the larger brother of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=563\">Poly 88<\/a>.\n<b>William Davis<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">This unit could connected to an add-on unit (MS 88) that consisted of two 8\" Shugart DSDD disk drives. Near the end Polymorphic System also featured a 10 MB hard disk and a unit called the \"Twin Systems\" which allowed two simultaneous users on a shared bus.\nI had all the above, buying the first of three 8813 in 1978 and continuing to use it until 1987 when I switched to a series of Kaypro machines. As a last attempt to stay alive Poly tried to market a CP\/M based version. I also had one of these which was an unmitigated disaster.\nThe software sold by Polymorphic Systems consisted of a Word Processor (very much like the early WordStar), a data base program and their OS.<\/font>\n\n<b>Kyle York<\/b> reports us :\n<font color=\"#666666\">It doesn't use a specific operating system. It could add\/extend, delete files but the filesystem was a linked-list. To recover disk space you had to run a utility. Best use was a business-basic package that was incredible.<\/font>\n\n<b>Charles A Thompson<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">with respect to memory, the Poly was capable of handling 64K -- of which about 8K was for the operating system roms. I have (still have!) several 8813s. One of them has a 48K memory board and an 8K memory board, which placed the upper end of memory at about 56K.\nIt took some time for the IBM PC-type of machine to catch up to the capabilities Poly already had when the PC was first introduced (such as subdirectories). Poly could have lengthy file names (up to 32 characters, as I recall, which included any subdirectory names), plus a two-character extension.\nI still run several Poly programs, which I significantly wrote, such as General Ledger and Payroll (that is, I got some very crude programs, and rewrote them extensively).\nIn addition to their Word Master word processing program, PolyMorphic Systems also sold programs entitled Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Inventory Control, Mailist, Plan (Polymorphic Language for ANalysis), Universal Plotter, and Loan and Investment Analysis. There were probably others -- those are just the ones I have in my collection. Poly also made available a Field Service manual, which contained a significant amount of technical data (I have one of these, also).\nMost of the programs were dated 1978, and it's my understanding that these were spruced-up versions of programs originally written for internal purposes by Interactive Products Corporation (aka PolyMorphic Systems).<\/font>\n<b>Nick Taylor<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I bought a used Poly 8813 from my friend Stuart Woods, who is now a famous writer, in about 1979.  It came with an IBM Selectric typewriter that had been converted to a printer and sat atop a massive cabinet full of wires.  Its WordMaster word processor was the best around at the time, but the only tech support came from other PolyMorphic users.  One of these was Mark Sutherland, Atlanta's resident PolyMorphic genius, whom I bothered on an almost daily basis.  I was still using the Poly when I moved to New York in 1984, and found a fanatic Poly user on Long Island whose name I don't recall, but who was kind enough to answer my usually dense questions.  He was using Polys and WordMaster to produce newsletters including one for Poly users, and continued to do so into the late 1980s.  I produced my first book, Bass Wars, on the Poly but the support problems became too much for me to overcome.  I sold my Poly for parts to the fellow on Long Island and switched to PCs, but I remember it fondly, kind of like a difficult love relationship.<\/font>",

In 1982 they came out with the S-Plus system primarily for small businesses.\nUtilizing Motorola's 68B09, the 2mhz version of the same chip that powered the Radio Shack Color computer, and the SS-50 bus they reached an agreement with Technical Systems Consultants of NC to provide a multi-user processing system based on a more user friendly sub-set of Unix called UniFLEX.\nThe 68B09 was a 8\/16 bit computer. Internal process was done in 16 bits, but bus I\/O was still 8 bits.  Memory came in 250K boards, the bus could accommodate 4 boards, however, because of hardware I\/0 address conflicts, only 750K could be accessed as RAM.\nThe UniFLEX operating system allocated up to 64K to each task (running program) and when operated in multi-user mode, made use of memory swapping to the HD for virtual memory.\nWhile bus configuration allowed up to 18 serial ports, in reality, only 6-10 ports configured as multi-user was practical.  If the application was CPU or I\/O intensive, then that number might be reduced to 2 or 3 active users.\nEarly versions had dual 8\" Floppy Drives 20 MB Seagate hard drives, but later versions used up to 2 40 MB ATASI drives through a Western Digital Controller. A Streaming Tape was also available.\nThe UniFLEX operating system was a dream, patterned after UNIX but with easier, more english language like commands emulated their Unix counterparts. commands like makdir, copy, list, find, search.  Basic, Compiled Basic, Fortran 77, Cobol (patterned after Data Generals with VSAM files and a screen section).\nIt had a printer spooler that had features that most don't have even today.\nWhy did it not become popular.  My option is that the primary problem was lack of trust between the hardware manufacturer and the operating system supplier. Having dealt with both sides as president of the Users Group I found both sides to be paranoid about sharing information with each other.\nAs a result, hardware\/software development was slow, and with a lot of finger pointing.  While it was marketed it as a business solution, they only developing programming and systems software, no applications.\nA few attempts were made by third parties to develop a spread sheet loosely based on VisiCalc, and word processor but no organized effort was made to develop an overall office solution.",

The expansion module #3 uses part of the Colecovision hardware, thus the memory unit doesn't have any cartridge slot, and isn't delivered with any controllers nor TV switch box.\nThe whole system is made of the daisywheel printer, the memory unit and the keyboard. The power supply is built-in the printer!\nThe Smart Basic isn't in ROM and has to be loaded from a tape, however there's a little word processor in ROM, this word processor prints the text to the printer at the same time the user types on the keyboard, but can also be used as a classic wordprocessor.\nThe Adam had a pretty short life, only two years! Despite this there is still a community of Adam fans who still use their system. Nowadays, most Adam users use a 320k 5 1\/4 inch disk drive, an external 2400 baud modem, and a 20, 30 or 40 megabyte IDE harddisk. Adams often have memory expanders up to 2 MB in size (which is usually used as a RAM disk), and also a parallel printer (like a bubble jet)!\nGreg Bowman reports that he got an external CD drive for his Adam from his uncle who was then Vice President of Coleco.

Two of them were dedicated to the AIM monitor program, including an instant input assembler (no labels) and a disassembler. Various programming languages (BASIC, FORTH...) or custom applications could be added in the three remaining sockets.\nSeveral cards were developped for this machine, especially language cards and ROMs: a BASIC card (BASIC language with floating point mathematics capabilities), PL\/65 (a mixture of the PL\/1 and Algol languages), Instant Pascal (an interpreted version of Pascal), Assembler and the FORTH programming language.",

Matra then worked with Hachette (both were owned by the Lagard?re group) to produce the documentation and to organize the distribution. Last but not least, the well known and excellent french illustrator Moebius drew a beautiful illustration for the docs and the box of the Alice.\nAlice is quite limited in its possibilities but is also quite pleasant to use. Its case is whole red and the computer really looks like a toy.\nSeveral educational programs were developed for this computer.\nThen in 1984, Matra presents a new version : The Alice 32 with 16 kb RAM and improved graphical possibilities.\nBut this computer was, like the MC 10, a flop in the marketplace.

The IMSAI front panel differed from the Altair in that you could also output to port 255 to a displayed LED buffer above the sense switches - a feature the Altair did not have (it only had input).  The Altair sense switch were used during boot into Altair DOS to specify the terminal port to the DOS.\nMITS made several peripherals and cards for this computer, namely, a video card, a serial card to connect a terminal, a RAM expansion card and a 8\" floppy drive that used hard sectored floppies and stored 300 KB.\nSeveral models were launched, they had the same characteristics except the CPU (8080 and later 8080A).\nBelieve it or not, the name \"Altair\" comes from Star Trek!

        "description": "The Commodore Amiga 2000 is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga 1000<\/a>. As the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=65\">Amiga 500<\/a> was the \"low-end\" model of the new products, the 2000 was considered the \"high-end\" model in 1985.\nLike the original Amiga, it uses the same memory configuration with chip RAM (512 KB which can be accessed by the custom chips) and fast RAM (the rest of memory which can be accessed only by the CPU).\nThere are three drive bays : two 3.5\" front bays and one 5.25\" front bay. A 5.25\" floppy drive or a half-height hard drive could be mounted into this last bay.\nA Commodore 8088-CPU bridgeboard (a PC-on-a-card) was available. When operating, 128k RAM is used as a \"bridge\" between the PC bus and the Amiga Bus. Two programs (called ARead and AWrite) make the data exchange between PC and Amiga possible. The ISA slots can be used only with the \"bridge\" card and are unused in \"Amiga mode\".\nThere are in fact 3 models and many variations of the A2000 :\nThe <b>Amiga 2000A<\/b>, the \"original A2000\" was designed in Germany and was based on a German Amiga 1000 motherboard. The system was based upon an interesting design but was restricted in many ways (the thin Agnus could only use 512 Kb RAM). The machine had a number of reliability problems representing a refinement of 1985 technology rather than an step forward.\nThe <b>Amiga 2000B<\/b> is a kind of mix between the redesigned German 2000A and a cost-reduced version of the A500. It is generally referred in the UK as the B2000.\nThe <b>Amiga 2000C<\/b> is the final version of the A2000. It is based upon the improved ECS Chipset, but otherwise it is identical to the 2000B. It is known as the Amiga 2000+ in the US and was shipped with the new improved Kickstart 2.04.\nThe model with a built-in disk controller and a hard disk was called the <b>Amiga 2000HD<\/b>, it was shipped with an A209x SCSI controller and a SCSI hard disk drive installed. \nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=907\">A2500<\/a> systems were based upon the final revisions of the A2000-B motherboard design before the A3000 was released.\nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=624\">A1500<\/a> was a UK-specific machine derived from the A2000, retailing at ?999 (UKP) during 1990. Apart from shipping with two floppy drives, 1Mb memory and a new nameplate there is hardly any difference between the A1500 and the A2000. \n<i>Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/amiga.emugaming.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amiga Interactive Guide<\/a><\/i>",

        "description": "After being on sale for only a few months the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1260\">Amiga 500 Plus<\/a> was replaced with the Amiga 600 in March 1992. \nThe smallest Amiga ever made, it is similar in size to a laptop and weighs just 6 lbs. Originally the A600 was to be sold alongside the A500+ as a budget model to be named the Amiga 300, but instead replaced the A500+ which required a name change. \nVery early models of the A600 have A300 printed on their motherboards, an indication of the confusion that was taking hold at Commodore after the surprise launch of the A500+. These early models also have a slightly different version of AmigaOS (although it is still version 2.05, it has the internal revision number 37.299) which doesn't have built-in support for the IDE or PCMCIA interfaces, the drivers for which must be loaded from a floppy disk. Later revisions of the AmigaOS (versions 37.300 &amp; 37.350) have these drivers built-in.\nThe small size of the A600 also added to the incompatibility problems of the A500+. The numeric keypad had been removed from the A600 and this added hardware incompatibility to the already existing AmigaOS incompatibilities. Problems occurred with software that used the numeric keypad for inputs, mostly flight sims but also things like spreadsheets or office software, although a numeric keypad emulator was later released to address this problem.\nAs usual with the Amiga there were a number of official and unofficial bundles were available, with prices starting at ?399. Also released was the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1261\">Amiga 600HD<\/a> which included a built-in hard drive.\nBut with the release of the powerful new <a href=\"computer.asp?c=628\">Amiga 1200<\/a> later the same year, and at the same price as the A600, a great opportunity was missed. By this time sales of the Amiga's great rival the Atari ST were slowing considerably and instead of marketing the A600 as a budget machine (as it should have been originally), it was effectively pushed out of the market thanks to competition from Commodore themselves.",

        "description": "Commodore's Amiga 500 was the low-end version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=63\">Amiga 2000<\/a> and the main competitor of Atari's 520\/1040 ST range. The A500 was superior in almost every area, apart from its MIDI capabilities and the disk drive, which was not only slow but very noisy as well and a bitter feud quickly developed between owners of these rival machines.\nHardware wise, the A500 is very similar to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga 1000<\/a>, the main internal differences being an increase in memory fom 256 KB to 512 KB and the addition of another custom chip named \"Gary\" (the only Amiga chip with a male name). This is a new I\/O chip that controls the disk drive and also performs address decoding. This chip is also used in the high-end A2000.\nThe A500 was easier to upgrade than both the ST and big box Amigas, thanks to an expansion port located in the bottom of the case. Owners could simply insert a small board which contained an extra 512 KB of Ram and a battery-backed clock. The popularity of this upgrade meant that more 1 MB software (both 1 MB versions of 512 KB software and 1 MB only software) was released for the Amiga than the ST, which had to be taken apart to expand the memory.\nOver the course of the A500s lifespan several different packages were available, the most basic of which included only the computer, TV modulator and Workbench disks. A number of bundles were also sold, such as the best selling \"Batman Pack\" which was released in 1989 and included 3 games and Deluxe Paint 2.\nThe A500 was discontinued in 1991 and replaced by the short lived <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1260\">Amiga 500 Plus<\/a>.\n<b>Pandy<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The Amiga 500 is a \"cleaned\" A1000, \"cleaned\" means plenty of TTL glue logic was replaced by custom IC which was named Gary. A500+ it is a new generation of custom IC's so called ECS (A500 have OCS). A500+, A3000, A600 have new graphics modes (1280 dots in line without overscan and 31Khz scanning similar to VGA - limited to 640 pixels in line with 4 colors).<\/font>",

        "description": "This was a very unique system with an extraordinary design. It was conceived by Ampere and produced by <b>Nippon-Shingo<\/b> in 1985. Sadly, it failed the US FCC certification tests and so was not available on the US market, which helps explain why it is so rare nowadays (along with its high price and narrow-targeted market)... \nOne of the main characteristics of the Ampere WS-1 was the use of the <b>APL<\/b> programming language : an interpreted language extremely synthetic and very rich. APL doesn't use English but rather a mathematical syntax which makes the programs legibility quite difficult... The language offers a large number of system functions especially for vector and array.  Thus matrix inversions, multi-linear regressions, and sorting functions are language primitives. Moreover, the APL-68000 (the APL version of the WS-1) had very powerful string manipulation functions such as finding and replacing a word by another word. Overall the language was very compact and one line of APL would take for example up to ten lines of Basic depending what you have to code. This is why it was possible to include <b>LPA<\/b> (Langage P?dagogique Audiovisuel) programs (developed in APL by the Saclay's C.E.A.) into the system. They act as a natural interface between the user and the application. For example it is possible to type \"<i>Who am I meeting on the 7th of march ?<\/i>\" or \"<i>What is the telephone number of the IBM chairman ?<\/i>\", and to get an answer ! LPA interfaces exist on other systems and were developed for different languages, but only APL made it possible to include LPA into a \"micro-computer\" like the Ampere WS-1. \nThe WS-1 was a real portable computer with its 80x25 LCD screen, a power-supply through built-in cells and a micro-tape recorder (300k) to store data or to record sound. The keyboard was compact and had thus no separate numeric keypad. Several keys had special signs used for APL programming. Eight function keys were placed directly at the bottom of the LCD screen. It was an excellent idea as explanations of the function of each key could be displayed directly above them according to the context of the running application. \nThe WS-1 offered many connection possibilities. It had one Centronics and two RS-232c ports, as well as an expansion port for optional disk-drives (700k each) or a hard-disk. It also had a VME-compatible connector which is an instruments measurement standard. \nThe system was powered by Ni-Cd cell batteries. Thus if the main power were accidently cut, all the memory would be saved and  found intact when the main power returns. You may find that feature \"normal\" nowadays, but it was quite a rare feature back in 1985 !\n \nThe WS-1 had 64k RAM, upgradable to 512k through CMOS cartridges, and 128k ROM in which are stored the operating system and the APL interpreter. The system offered a multitasking environment, or rather bi-tasking : two APL programs could run simultaneously, and in this case two windows could be opened on the screen showing the results of each program. The Ampere WS-1 ran under <b>Big-DOS<\/b>, the Operating System dedicated to the WS 1. \nSeveral programs were supplied with the computer: tools for the system configuration, communication and character redefinition. Optional software included Big Screen (word processor, spreadsheet, editor and painting applications for 2700 FF), APL-Calcand and very expensive specialised applications with LPA interfaces (agenda, travel agency management, Avocatix\/lawyer management, etc.)",

        "description": "The story of the development of the Apple 1 has became a \"legend\". Here's how it goes:\nSteve Wozniak, was working for Hewlett-Packard at the time, wanted to build his own computer. He couldn't afford the Intel 8080 CPU (this CPU was very popular then, as it was used in the Altair 8800 &amp; IMSAI 8080, but was pretty expensive). He would have used the Motorola 6800 but it was also much too expensive. Finally he decided to build his computer around the MOS 6502 (which was pretty compatible with the Motorola 6800).\nThe computer was easier to use than the Altair: notably, the Apple 1 had a keyboard connector and could display characters on a TV whereas the Altair used LEDs for display. The display rate was very slow, only 60 characters (!) per second.\nSteve Jobs, who programmed the game \"Breakout\" for Atari (with a little help from \"the Woz\"), was interested in this computer. Together they created the Apple Computer Company and tried to sell their computer. Paul Terrell, the owner of a computer shop, was interested in this computer, but fully assembled (the Apple 1 was sold \"naked\", no monitor, no power supply, no keyboard, no tape drive, etc.) and with a cassette interface, which Wozniak designed. He sold it with the Basic he wrote soon after.\nThey sold about two hundred of these units. This machine was so popular that Jack Tramiel of Commodore (!) offered to buy Apple. Apple was, at the time, a major purchaser of MOS 6502 processors and Commodore owned MOS Technologies. Wozniak wanted $15,000 more than Tramiel offered. Needless to say, the deal fell through.\nThe nowadays mythic Apple 1 was followed the next year by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple ][<\/a>.",

It was the very first commercial success of the Apple Computer Company.\nBecause Steve Wozniak wanted to demonstrate his Breakout game with the new Apple II, he decided to add colour, sound and minimum paddle support to the Apple 1's heir.\nThe Apple II came with 4 KB RAM, but it was possible to add 4 KB or 16 KB RAM chips. Thus, the system could have memory in the following sizes: 4K, 8K, 12K,16K, 20K, 24K, 32K, 36K, or a full 48K. This was one of the strong points of the Apple II: from the beginning, it was designed with expansion in mind. The 8 expansion slots were further proof of that - users could expand their system easily, just by plugging cards into the slots.\nThe ROM included the monitor, a 6502 disassembler, 'Sweet 16' a 16-bit CPU emulator and the Integer Basic written by Wozniak in machine language, assembled by hand on paper! Not having to load a language from tape or disk to start programing was also a significant advantage over competitors. Even the innovative plastic case proved to be an important feature to attract customers.\nJust a few months after the Apple II presentation at the First West Coast Computer Fair in April 1977, Apple received about three hundred orders for the Apple II, over a hundred more than the total number of Apple-1's sold.\nThe Apple II was followed in 1979 by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=571\">Apple II+<\/a>, which brought some enhancements.",

It was (and still is) a quantum leap for the Apple II line.\nSales were strong initially and the IIGS even outsold the black and white Macintosh units that were its contemporary. Sadly, Apple wanted Macintosh to be its future.  The total number of advertisements and commercials for the IIGS could probably be counted on one hand.  If the computer had been introduced a year or two earlier, things might have been different.  The Apple IIGS disappeared from the market in 1992.\nIn one final gasp, the Apple II supporters at Apple designed the Apple IIGS Plus, code named \"Mark Twain\". It had an 8Mhz 65C816, a built in SuperDrive, 2MB on the motherboard, and a hard drive. Prototypes leaked out and a user group that has one and wrote a series of articles about it. Apple management vetoed this unit. \nThe Ensoniq chip in the Apple IIGS was a brilliant move by Apple, but it drew a lawsuit from Apple Records, the Beatles' record label. Apple never again put a synthesizer chip in any computer. Even today, the Macintosh does not have hardware synthesizers. The Macintosh works around this by using software-based synthesis. \nIt had a lot of graphic modes : All modes used a 12-bit palette for 4096 colors.\n- 320x200 with 16 colors\n- 320x200 with 256 colors: in this mode, the VGC is taking advantage of the fact that it has memory for 16 separate palettes.  Each scan line can be assigned any one of these 16 palettes for a total of 256 possible colors.  This mode requires no CPU assistance and is often used in games. \n- 320x200 with 3200 colors: in this mode, the CPU is used to swap palettes into and out of video memory such that a separate 16 color palette can be used on each of the 200 scan lines for 3200 possible colors.  This mode is often used for viewing graphics.\n- 640x200 with 4 pure colors: this mode is bland and is not often used.\n- 640x200 with 16 dithered colors: in this mode, the pixels in the graphic screen are grouped into even and odd columns.  The even columns can have a palette of 4 pure colors out of a of a possible 4096. The odd columns can have a second palette of 4 pure colors. The GS dithers the adjacent colors for 4x4=16 dithered colors. This mode is widely used in productivity programs and also in Apple's Finder for the GS.\n- Fill mode: for faster rendering of graphics, fill mode is a hardware mode in which an outline of a graphic can be drawn and the outline filled by a solid color without needing to draw in all the pixels.\nCombinations and variations: the Apple IIGS supported scan line interrupts. Part of the screen could be in 640x200 mode while another part could be in 20x200 resolution. Such split modes were sometimes used in paint programs, where the menu bar was in 640x200 while the graphic was in 320x200. \n          \nSVGA modes with 24-bit color could be added with an additional video card (see the Second Sight SVGA card at Sequential Systems at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sequential.com\">http:\/\/www.sequential.com\/<\/a><a>).\nThe Apple IIGS also had all the graphics modes found on the <\/a><a href=\"computer.asp?c=69\">Apple IIc<\/a>.\n- Text mode: 40x24 and 80x24.  Characters are formed by a 7x8 pixel matrix. Text mode is monochrome but can be set to a specific color.  The background and border can each be set to different colors. Text mode is rarely used in GS programs since the OS, GS\/OS, had a graphic desktop. \n- Low Resolution: 40x48 pixels in 16 colors. \nDouble Low Resolution: 80x48 pixels in 16 colors. \nHigh Resolution: 280x192 pixels in 6 colors \nDouble High Resolution: 560x192 pixels in 16 colors. \nCombinations\/Variations: 4 lines of text mode could be mixed with a truncated Low Resolution or High Resolution mode graphic.  The text in mixed mode could be either 40 column or 80 column.  Double Low Res and Double High Res modes couldn't be mixed with text.\nThe \"SmartPort\" external drive port supports both Apple IIe\/IIc UniDisks (3.5\" and 5.25\" models) and Apple IIGS daisy-chain 3.5\" drives and Apple 5.25\" disks.  It was sold with a 3.5\" floppy drive which not only worked on this computer, but on the Macintosh as well. It was also designed to support the Chinook CT-series 20MB to 100MB SmartPort hard drives, but Apple IIGS users usually added an SCSI card to the system for faster hard drive access.\nThe difference between a UniDisk and a IIGS 3.5\" drive is that the IIGS drive is controlled directly by the computer while the UniDisk has a separate processor. The UniDisk is thus much slower (up to 4x slower) than a IIGS 3.5\" drive.\nThe SmartPort can support two 800K 3.5\" drives, two 140K 5.25\" drives, and one 100MB CT100 hard drive simultaneously daisy-chained to each other.\nThe Apple IIGS often shipped with the Apple High Speed (DMA) SCSI controller in an expansion slot for controlling SCSI devices.  Even 100MB Zip Drives and 1 GB Jazz Drives work on this SCSI port. A SuperDrive controller could be added for using 1.44MB high density floppy drives.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=71\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It caused the internal temperature to get so hot that the motherboard would warp and some of the socketed chips would become unseated. To remedy this, Apple told people to literally pick up the computer several centimeters off the desk and drop it! It was a miserable flop in the marketplace. \nThe Apple \/\/\/ was followed in december 1983 by the Apple \/\/\/ plus which had  an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=83\">Apple IIe<\/a> style keyboard and a new video interface.

They contacted Radofin Electronics Far East, based in Hong-Kong, who was manufacturing most of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Intellivision products<\/a>. Radofin had just developped a line of three Z80 based computers. Mattel decided to sell the two first under their brand. The Aquarius 1 and 2 were born.\nThe Mattel Aquarius used a special version of the Microsoft Basic. When used with Basic, only 1.7 KB remained available.\nThere were no redefinable characters, but 256 predefined chars were available: 128 ASCII (numerals, upper and lower case alphabet, punctuation, symbols) and 128 graphic patterns. That was the only \"graphical\" features of the Aquarius !\nUnfortunately the specifications were so poor for a 1983 computer, that the Aquarius 1 litteraly bombed. Three months after its release, Mattel decided to cancel the project and to sell back the rights and stocks to Radofin.\nRadofin continued to sell Aquarius 1 &amp; 2 under its own name, but without success...\nCool addons were developped for the Aquarius, but never made it to the shelves (apparently). There were a Master Expansion Module equipped with disk-drives and expansion slots for future add-ons. It even offered the CP\/M compatibility!\nAnother sympathetic extension was the Home Computer System Command Console which allowed the Aquarius to directly control up to 255 electric devices. But when the computer was connected to this extension, it couldn't be used for anything else!\nThere were also a Modem planned and Mattel even announced network services for games and programs downloads...\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=73\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

The 400 series had 1 to 4 MB of memory and four slots (three 64 pin and one 96 pin). The 500 series had 16 MB of RAM.\nThe operating system, first named <b>Arthur<\/b> then subsequently <b>RiscOS<\/b>, was in ROM along with the WIMP graphic interface (Windows Menu Icon Pointer), the fast BBC BASIC V interpreter and various utility programs, among them a Paint package, a music editor and an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">Acorn BBC model 2<\/a> emulator.\nThe built-in 800 KB 3.5\" floppy drive was compatible with the old 640 KB format.

        "description": "The Atari 400 and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=460\">800<\/a> were the first home computers to use custom coprocessors and the first to use \"sprites\" and special video interruptions like display lists, features that will be implemented later on the Commodore <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">64<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a> (Atari 400\/800 and Amiga were designed by Jay Miner).\nIt offered high graphic resolution, lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then ! The two models had same characteristics, the 400 is the low-cost version, it has only 16 KB (instead of 48 KB), one cartridge port (two for the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=460\">800<\/a>) and a membrane keyboard (a typewriter style keyboard one for the 800).\nOriginally, the 400 was sold with 8 KB RAM, but later most 400s were shipped with 16 KB. The 800 was expandable to 48 KB by adding cartridges, as the case opened upwards to reveal 3 slots behind the program cartridge slots. The expansion in the 400 (which had an identical motherboard) was only available by removal of the top half of the case, as it did not open past the (single) program cartridge slot, and was only possible through a registered Atari dealer.\nThe Atari 400 was known inside Atari as code name \"Candy\". \n___________\n<b>Tristan Smith<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The keyboard was very much disliked on this thing.  There were several replacement keyboards on the market.  Some connected via cable to one of the ports (and required a TSR program be loaded). Others required you open the system up and replace the actual keyboard. One that I remember was adhesive!  It had all the keys on it with \"eraser\" type rubber things on the underside.  You peeled off the backing and attached it over the membrane keyboard.  When you pressed a key, the eraser would press the membrane key.  As unresponsive as that was, it was still better than the original.\nNot too many people realized that the Joystick ports were true I\/O and could be used to control devices.  There were a bunch of items that used the joystick ports.  I remember building a phone dialer with them....\n<\/font>\n<b>Adin Seskin<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The sound on these computers was particularly impressive.  Apart from 4 square-wave generators, you could covert them to 2 voices with a far greater frequency range, and the voice generator could also produce general video-game noises very easily - explosions, machine noises etc.\nAt one point a surprisingly good software-based speech synthesizer was developed, to exploit the sound chip.  It had to disable all interrupts, especially video DMA, in order to generate the sounds, which rather limited its use.\nNot many people know that the same sound generator was also used for data encoding when saving programs or data to the cassette or disk systems.<\/font>",

It used the shell of the Atari Mega ST4 and its mouse. It held 512 KB of RAM, an optional 20 or 23 MB HDD, but didn't have ISA extension slot, to use a PC card, an expansion box was necessary.\nHowever, the PC-1 had Parallel, serial and mouse ports built-in as well as an universal video interface allowing either colour CGA and EGA or Hercules monochrome monitors to be connected to the same video port.\nThe range of Atari PC compatible systems was also comprised of:\n? The <b>PC3<\/b>, a 8088 8Mhz based system with 640 KB ram, CGA graphics and 20MB hard drive,\n? The <b>PC4<\/b>, a 80286 16Mhz based system with a 60MB hard drive in which - optionally- a 3.5 1.44 Mb drive could be fitted (the front needed to be cut out and the metal casing sawed by the user). It also featured VGA graphics,\n? The <b>ABC<\/b>, a 80386sx 16Mhz model with a 40MB hard disk and vga graphics. This one came with a 3.5 floppy built in,\n?

        "description": "This rare portable computer had a short life. It was designed and manufactured by Athena Computer &amp; Electronic Systems in San Juan Capistrano, California (USA).\nAt 15 pounds, the Athena 1 is significantly lighter than some of the other portable computers of its time. It includes a standard full-quality keyboard and a 4-line-by-80-character LCD display.\nWhen first launched, the Athena I had an unusual but interesting dual-processor design using NSC-800 CPUs, a low-power version of the Zilog Z80 from National Semiconductor that uses a CMOS design for minimal energy consumption. One serves as a central processing unit and the other handles input and output.\nA built-in lead acid battery operates the machine for up to two hours. Memory can be retained for up to six hours in a standby mode. A 12-volt power cable for operation from an automobile cigarette-lighter was also included with the system.\nIt was equiped with a 128KB to 1MB solid state mass storage (in the form of dynamic RAM) which emulates floppy disk drive (expandable to one megabyte). RAM memory acts as a drive A under CP\/M 2.2 that is provided with the machine in ROM. An external 5.25\" disk drive could also be connected. It had two RS232 ports to connect printers, screen terminals or communication devices.\nBesides CP\/M 2.2 operating system, the Athena comes with JRT Pascal from JRT Systems in San Francisco, the Profit Plan spreadsheet from Chang Labs in Sunnyvale, and the MiniVEDIT text editor from CompuView Products in Ann Arbor.\n15 Athenas can be connected together to create a local network, allowing access to common data bases and mass-storage devices. Each system in the network can read the memory of any other system. A 30MB hard-disk was available allowing all networked units to share common data files.\nApparently it could be the first \"clamshell\" laptop computer to be exhibited, some time before the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=900\">Grid Compass<\/a>.\nIt was a powerful system, but its small LCD and external floppy drive limited its usefulness. In 1983, the company switched to a single low-power Intel 80C86 CPU, the first computer to do so, and offered MS-DOS along with CP\/M.\nThe photo shown here is of the prototype that was displayed at trade shows.\nDavid Mitchell who founded the firm in 1982, calls his product a \"high-end\" machine designed for the discriminating portable user.\"",

Its main difference with the Oric 1 was the keyboard and the debugged ROM (the ORIC 1 had several bugs). Although improved, the loading process from tape was still very uncertain. The real mechanical keyboard was really better.\nTwo versions were available, with 16 or 48 KB of RAM. 16 KB version couldn't be upgraded, very few of them were sold.  \nThere were also new Basic instructions and above all the Scart power supply was integrated on French models from 85! Fantastic, when you know that the Oric had the world record of cables and power supplies you had to use (1 for the computer, 1 for the tape recorder, 1 for the peritel supply and 1 more plug for the TV!).\nThe Atmos had really large success in France like its little brother the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=180\">Oric-1<\/a>. A lot of videogame companies got off the ground thanks to this machine, and quite a lot of people have a tender thought when then remember their Atmos.\nIn 1985, Eureka Informatique, a french company, bought back Oric. The Atmos then lived a bit longer thanks to some improvements (peritel power supply and better tape reliability) and cheap prices policy.\nThe Atmos was somehow legally licenced in Yugoslavia as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1186\">Nova 64<\/a>.\nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=988\">Pravetz 8D<\/a> was a bulgarian clone of the Atmos.",

        "description": "The Acorn Atom was the ancestor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">BBC computers series<\/a>. It was sold in kit or ready-assembled versions.\nThe great advantage of the Atom compared to its competitors (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=409\">TRS-80<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"computer.asp?c=191\">PET<\/a>), was its high resolution capabilities (256 x 192) which were quite unusual in 1979 for the price. \nThe built-in BASIC was in some ways quite limited (it could only use integers for example) but an optional 4K ROM added the ability to use floating point numbers, trigonometric functions, to convert degrees\/radians and to draw graphics in color. More add-ons were also available enabling autonumbering, a faster cassette interface (1200 bauds), and functions such as INKEY$, MID$, READ, DATA, FILL, etc...\nThere was even a BBC BASIC board available. \nA lot of applications were available on sideways ROMs that plugged into the \"utility ROM socket\" as Acorn called it, such as the \"Atom Word Pack ROM\" (word processing) or Atom-Calc (a 4K ROM spreadsheet).\nA colour card was available, connected to the BUS connector, it provided 8 colors, 4 simultaneously at the 64 x 192 resolution or 2 at 128 x 192 for example. But it was known to overheat! \nA lot of other peripherals were developed :\n- a 5.25\" floppy disk drive (100K) which held the DOS in a 3K ROM but cost about twice as much as a new Atom!,\n- a digital-tape recorder,\n- a printer interface,\n- a network card called EcoNet which enabled linking of up to 250 Atoms (210 K\/Bauds transfer rate),\n- RAM expansions,\n- etc...\n_________\n<b>Mr Wobbler<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The overheating of the graphics card seemed due to the conversion from NTSC to PAL. THE VC chip could be just seen under the mountain of discrete components to convert the scan rate... Programming the atom was fun, allowing the mixing of in-line assembler code embedded in basic programs.  This made the transition from high level to assembler programming easier. My father bought one and had 2 subsequent replacements  supplied FOC by Acorn due to problems in the video circuitry (mostly the output frequency wandering). <\/font>\n<b>Peter Passchier<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The speaker was not just a beeper. You have direct write access to the I\/O port, and it could be made to beep at a particular pitch by 'toggling' the speaker at a particular frequency. I used to use a one-liner that I would type in manually at night to wake me up with a warble at a desired time in the morning!<\/font>",

Despite its ordinary characteristics (like those of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Sinclair Spectrum<\/a> and often less interesting than those of the others like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a> or Atari <a href=\"computer.asp?c=27\">XL<\/a>\/<a href=\"computer.asp?c=21\">Xe<\/a> series) or odd features (like video memory or strange floppy disk format), it was very popular because of its really low price and its interesting commercial concept : all peripherals were sold together (like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=191\">Commodore PET<\/a> that was sold years earlier): CPU\/keyboard, tape recorder, monitor (monochrome green or colour).\nA huge number of programs and peripherals were developed for this machine. It ran AmsDos (Amstrad's Operating System). AmsDos was completely embedded in the Basic using so-called RSX  commands starting with |, but it could not \nformat disks, you needed a special application for that.\nThe 464 also could use CP\/M 2.2 or 3.0 when used with an external Floppy disk unit (3\" Hitachi, 180 KB \/ face). A lot of great CP\/M software was adapted for the Amstrad CPC.\nAbout 42 KB RAM was available for the user, the video memory and the ROM were mapped on the same addresses with a dedicated chip to switch the memory banks automatically.  \nNotice that the first Amstrad CPC prototype (called \"Arnold\", which gave the name ROLAND (Arnold acronym) to several CPC games) was built around a 6502 processor and then changed to a Z80 late in the computer?s development. A few months later, the CPC series would be completed with a computer which offered a built-in floppy disk unit: the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=112\">CPC 664<\/a>.\n<b>Ekkehard Morgenstern<\/b> from Germany reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nAMSDOS could be run only with Amstrad's 3\" floppy disk drive. CP\/M could be run either with 3\" floppy disk drives or other drives available on the market. (I had a 5 1\/4\" Vortex disk drive with 704K capacity)\nActually CP\/M was pretty good compared to MS-DOS, but of course it was only 8 bit. Interesting was that the Z80 processor was downwards compatible to the 8080 processor and hence allowed the 8-bit CP\/M to be run without changes. But when programming in assembly language, you had to use the 8080 instruction set which had different mnemonics than the Z80's. \nThere was a lot of cool add-on hardware for the CPC. I had a MAXAM module which had a built-in editor, assembler and disassembler in ROM. This made it fairly easy to write BASIC and assembly mixed programs. (It would've been better though if the Locomotive BASIC would've had the ability to mix BASIC and assembly, like the BBC computer did)\nLocomotive BASIC was surprisingly fast at the time and had even software interrupts, with which it was possible to react to hardware interrupts that were passed to the BASIC interpreter. Hence you could write programs that behaved like multitasking apps. The language also had an advanced sound architecture containing commands to define different wave-forms.\nThe tape drive routines in ROM had variable baud rate parameters, and so it was possible to store programs at 19200 baud or higher. However, this could lead to read errors of course, which was used as a copy protection by many programs sold on tape.\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The Sinclair PC 200 was one of the last computers built under the Sinclair brand (along with the PC-500). In fact it was not a Sinclair at all, but a desktop version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=195\">Amstrad PPC-512<\/a>.\nThe case bore a striking resemblance to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari 520 ST<\/a> case. It had a built-in 3.5\" floppy drive on the right and mouse and joystick ports under the keyboard. And indeed the PC-200 was officially marketed as an Atari 520-ST competitor : same price, same disk drive, same memory (512k) and same design.\nBut compared to the Amiga and 520-ST, the PC-200 looked like a naked pea, even for an IBM compatible. Its two ISA slots were not enough to reasonably expand the system. Standard IBM expansion cards were nearly twice the height of the computer, thus the computer needed to be opened permanently!\nIn 1988, the MDA and CGA graphic modes were quite obsolete as most PC systems had adopted the more convenient EGA mode.\nAn interesting feature of the PC-200 was a TV output socket at the rear of the system, quite rare for a PC compatible system. It shows that Amstrad wanted to market the PC-200 as a low-range PC compatible system for the whole family.\nAt the same time, Amstrad presented the PC 20, which was in fact the same computer as the Sinclair PC 200 except for the color of the case (black for the Sinclair, white for the Amstrad) and the TV output (not implemented on the PC-20).\n<b>Angus WR Gullivers<\/b> reports to us :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The Sinclair PC200 had absolutely no success, it bombed and was withdrawn very quickly from the market. It was advertised for only about 3 months. It was released to poor reviews because of its lack of expansion possibilities and use of CGA graphics when EGA and VGA were already available.<\/font>",

It was built in the UK at Tatung's plant in Telford in Shropshire.\nThe Einstein runs under Xtal\/DOS which is an operating system compatible with CP\/M. It was possible to connect an other floppy disk drive and a 80 column card was available.\nThe Einstein was a very attractive computer but it was too expensive to have great market success.\n<b>Ste Cork<\/b> recalls:\n<font color='#666666\"'>Pretty much every 8-bit development house in the NW of the UK was using these machines in the late '80s, we'd develop for Atari, C64, ZX, Amstrad, MSX, C16, you name it.  Superb keyboard, and the power-supply was so stable that you could quickly flick the switch off and on without the machine even noticing.  No mains spikes could ever interrupt these things.   I even wrote \/ sold a couple of games on it natively, they did ok. We mainly used them with 5.25 inch disks though, since the 3-inch disks it used weren't so reliable if you were writing to them continuously.  The 256MB silicon-drive was a must-have.Doomed to be for hobbyists \/ developers only though, since it had no mass market appeal at the price \/ performance.<\/font>\n<b>Alan Wilson<\/b> reports us:\n<font color=\"#666666\"> This computer at the time was a programmers dream, the operating system was easy to reprogram, and an excellent MOS (Machine operating system)  mode meant that disk sectors or tracks could be easily loaded into memory, edited, then written back. Because of this, they were used to develop disk copy protection for the up and coming next generation <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari ST<\/a>.<\/font>\n<b>Trefor Hazlewood-Jones<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nUnlike most home computers this one boots up in MOS, it is then necessary to load Xtal\/dos and a high level operating system. Xtal\/basic was supplied with the machine but I also have disks to boot it into BBC\/basic FORTRAN and Pascal. The right hand drive bay will accept a 3.5 inch floppy drive and the machine will happily format and use 3.5 inch floppy disks.<\/font>\n<b>Note<\/b>: A 3.5\" drive requires modifications to the case and it will only format 720K floppies. You need an updated DOS system first to enable you to access more than the standard DOS\nEinstein and Spectrum games, by <b>Matthew Wilkes<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere was a nifty assembler specially written that we used to use at Elite Systems for programming the ZX Spectrum games - enabling you to write and assemble Z80 code, then download to the Spectrum via interface I (F5 I think it was :-)) - if your buggy code crashed, you could simply re-boot the Spectrum and debug on the Einstein.<\/font>",

A Japanese company called ASCII corporation (directed by Kay Nishi) decided to create an industry standard for home computers: MSX was born. MSX means <b>Machines with Software eXchangeability<\/b>. This is the true and only meaning, stop spreading the word about another explanation please.\nThe new standard was based on an existing computer: The Spectravideo SV 318 which can be considered as a beta version of MSX1 computers. Microsoft designed then MSX1 computers and the first version of the OS: MSX DOS 1 (which looks like early versions of MS-DOS).\nAlmost every Japanese and Korean computer companies made their own MSX computers (except maybe NEC). Bill Gates was then very confident about the future of the MSX standard. \nSpectravideo (one of the MSX companies) made an 80 column card and adapted CP\/M for the MSX.\nA lot of programs (especially a lot of games from Sega, Konami, Taito, ASCII, etc.) and hardware were developed for this standard. Despite all its qualities, the MSX family didn't have great success in USA. However it was pretty well known in Europe (particularly in the Netherlands and France), in South America (Brazil specifically) and Russia (then the USSR). This standard was replaced in 1985 by <a href=\"computer.asp?c=288\">MSX 2<\/a>.",

It was a frightful device.\nBoth colour and monochrome screens were offered, and were excellent. The colour monitor had, as I recall, three seperate banks of 16K of RAM, one for each of the primary colours, providing an early form of 24-bit colour. Power for the main unit was provided through the monitor. Two people were needed to safely carry the colour monitor.\nThe floppy disks were made by YE-Data and offered good capacity for the time - in the order of 500KB. They were of the solenoid head loading type and were ponderously slow but generally quite reliable.\nCP\/M 2.2 and a standalone version of MS-Basic were supplied. Each system used its own disk format. Sadly, these were not interchangeable. Bitmapped graphics were implemented through the MS-Basic system only, as were the bezel-mounted screen \"hotkeys\".\nThe IF-800 was crippled commercially by appearing on the market at the same time as the IBM PC-XT, which cost slightly less as I recall.\nThey were distributed in Canada by Canada Computer of Markham, Ontario.<\/font>",

Olympia was Germany's most respected and advanced typewriter and desktop calculator company at that time.

It runs under Prologue or CP\/M, and was delivered with MicroSoft Basic 5.21 and BAL. BAL is a programming language which looks like Basic and Cobol rolled together. It is associated always with the Prologue OS and allows files management. A few other languages were available : Fortran 80, Cobol 80, Pascal MT+ and assembler.\nBy patching the CP\/M System the machine could read any standard or non-standard CP\/M formatted disk up to 720 KB, even 3.5'' disks were easily pluggable. This way user could import\/export data and programms from\/to any CP\/M based computers, even the very popular Amstrad\/Schneider CPC series.\n<b>Steve Spring<\/b>, who was technical project manager for the Boss at Olympia's UK division in Marylebone, London for eight months at the time it was launched, reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The existing sales staff in Olympia did not have the first clue what they were dealing with, totally failing to understand the fundamental difference between the type of post sales support required for an electric type writer and that required for a PC (and in those fledgling days life was a lot simpler!!!).<\/font>\n<b>Erik van Asperen<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">I've been a programmer for years using BAL, and it's definitively a (Business) BASIC dialect. The only language constructs resembling COBOL are variable structures known in COBOL as redefines and filedescriptors. But I guess these are language features also known in other languages under different names. BAL certainly is not COBOL as I used to program in both languages. In the early nineties a BAL version (then already rechristened ABAL) for DOS and UNIX was available.<\/font>",

In fact, the only star of this show was the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=922\">Atari 130 ST<\/a> !\nIt was the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a> and could use all the software and a lot of the hardware of the C64 (the 8502 could be slowed down 1 MHz for compatibility).\nOne of the main specialities of this machine was the additional Z80 CPU and Video chip, which means that you could attach two monitors. Thanks to the Z80, the Commodore 128 could run under CP\/M + : lots of software were adapted for this computer and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=122\">Osborne<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=148\">Kaypro<\/a> programs could run directly.\n<b>The 128D model: <\/b>\nThe 128D was the direct successor of the Commodore 128 : it had exactly the same characteristics as the 128 except its external case which contained the Commodore 1571 floppy disk unit.\nActually there were two distinct Commodore 128Ds : The 128D and the 128D-CR (for Cost Reduced).\nDifferences between the 128D and the 128DCR were :\n - The 128D was never sold in the U.S. because of all the radio frequency interference it gave off.\n- the 128D-CR had a metal case rather than plastic for solving radio frequency problems. This version was sold in the U.S.\n- the 128D-CR did not have a cooling fan, although there was a place to mount one.\n- the 128D-CR case did not have storage clips for the keyboard.\n- the 128D-CR came with 64k of video RAM (for the RGB video chip) rather than 16k for the C128.\n- the 128D-CR's printed circuit board was different, and included the drive electronics. So there were 3 CPUs on the board.\n- the 128D-CR came with bugfixed (1986) ROMs in two 32k x 8 chips instead of four 16k x 8 ones.\n- The internal drive's ROM was different from the original 1571 ROM in two ways: it was bugfixed, and had changes for the new support chips. The bugfixes were bigger than the changes for the new hardware.\n- 128D-CR CPU RAM was in four 64k x 4 chips rather than sixteen 64k x 1 ones.\n- the 128D-CR did not have a carrying handle.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=96\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The commodore 64 is, along with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=27\">Atari XL<\/a> computers, the most famous home computer. According to the 2001 edition of Guinness book of records, the C64 was the most \"prolific  computing device ever manufactured\". During its production run from 1982 to... 1993, about 30 million (!) units were sold. To put this number in perspective, that's more than all the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=271\">Macintoshes<\/a> in the world.\nThe C64 was an up-market version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=252\">VIC-20<\/a>. A wide range of software packages, games and programming languages was available for this machine which was itself available practically anywhere from a toyshop to a business supplier.\nSuperficially, the C64 closely resembled the VIC-20. It had the same casing, an identical keyboard configuration and virtually the same interfaces and sockets. But the apparent similarity belies some fundamental differences: a MOS 6510 processor and 64 KB of RAM which was quite unusually large  at the time for a model of this price range. The C64 also had the ability to recognise user-established priorities by which 'sprites' (or movable blocks) could move independently of displayed text\/graphics, enabling the creation of graphics with up to 8 layers.\nMusic synthesis was performed by a special sound interface chip. Sound envelope could be controlled on all three voices on a full nine octave of each. \nIt was one of the first computers to offer both a high quality sound chip and graphic resolution with many colors and sprites.\nA great range of peripherals was developed for this computer and it can also use several of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=252\">Vic 20<\/a> peripherals.\nSeveral versions of the Commodore 64 were launched :\n \nThe first one, <b>C64-1<\/b>, used the VIC 20 case and was to be quickly replaced with the <b>C64-2<\/b> (pictured) which used the famous brown case, and later by the <b>C64-3<\/b> with small cosmetic changes in the keyboard.\n \nA special version called <a href=\"computer.asp?c=655\">Educator 64<\/a> or PET64 or CBM 4064 was proposed for schools and uses the PET case.\nCommodore produced the first generation of C64s until May 1986, then it was discontinued and they introduced the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=998\">C64C<\/a>. According to the 64'er magazine, this version has been planned since the Hannover Fair in 1985, but as the old version sold so well during Christmas '85, its release date was delayed.\n \nThen appeared the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1138\">C64 \"Aldi\"<\/a> (1987, only in Germany) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1136\">C64G<\/a> (1989). They were virtually same machines, this time with the new, short motherboard. So, although the case might look the same and the label says \"Commodore 64\", the boards may be completely different.\nFinally, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=768\">C64GS<\/a> game console was released in 1990. Basically it was a re-boxed C64, without a keyboard or any other interfaces, except for the cartridge slot on top.",

The cable feeding the video to the monitor was a simple 2 core unsheilded RCA cable. The mono minitor had a switch at the back so that one could swap foreground and background (green on black or black on green)\nBoth the FP-1000 and FP-1100 had a built in OS called C82 BASIC. To run CP\/M, you had to insert your systems diskette and reboot the computer, or if the program diskette had it's own boot strap, you could issue a \"mount [1,2]\" command where the number [1\/2] indicated the diskette drive you wanted to use.\nYou could run multiple console sessions on the FP-1000\/1100 toggling between them with the blue function keyboard keys that can be seen on the image. Some programs (eg SuperCalc) ussurped these keys and you were stuck in the console session until you stopped the program.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Zieg Nielsen<\/b> for the info.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=101\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Commodore Amiga CDTV is, in a way, the ancestor of the Amiga CD32 game console. \nBasically, it is an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=65\">Amiga 500<\/a> with a CDROM drive. It was sold without keyboard or mouse, but it was possible to connect them to the CDTV.\nA 3.5\" floppy disk drive (800 KB), was developed for this computer.\nIt was designed to be a home entertainment device, but it was too expensive and only very little software was developed for this machine (Psygnosis  made almost all the software for the CDTV).\nIn fact, a few years later Philips succeeded with its CD-I where Commodore failed.\nThere were two CDTV models : the CDTV-1 used the Amiga 500 hardware and the CDTV-2 used the Amiga 500+ hardware.\nThere even has been a prototype developed in 1992 called \"CDTV-CR\" (for Cost Reduced). Unlike other Amiga CR revisions, the CDTV CR was completely redesigned, utilizing the updated Amiga 600 technology (for more information, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/amiga.emugaming.com\/prototypes\/cdtvcr.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amiga Interactive Guide<\/a>).\nThe manager of the team promoting the CDTV was Nolan Bushnell, the man who founded Atari.  By strange twist of fate, the man in charge of Atari at the time, was Jack Tramiel, the man who founded Commodore.",

        "description": "<font color=\"#666666\">The following information comes from Death Adder :<\/font>\nOne of the rarest Commodore machines ever. Only very few units have been built with case, a few (more) without. As opposed to the widely held opinion, this computer is NOT called '<a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">C64<\/a> laptop'.\nCommodore developed this 3 pounds laptop in 1984 and presented it to the public at the Consumer Eletronics Show in January 1985 (Winter CES). In contradiction to what you might think when you first hear of a Commodore laptop, this machine has nearly nothing to do with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=96\">Commodore 128<\/a> - alas.\nThe factory population was 32k of static CMOS RAM, internally expandable to 64k using standard memory chips. It was externally expandable with another 64k of RAM.\nIts display was one of the best on the market available at that time, made by Commodore's own optoelectronics division, which was sold off shortly after the C=LCD was cancelled. The resolution in graphics mode was 480x128, and 80x16 in text mode. Although only 16 lines could be displayed simultaneously, the virtual screen size was 25 lines.\nLike the Commodore 264 series (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=194\">Plus\/4<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=97\">C16, C116<\/a>), the Commodore LCD had built-in software, but as opposed to the unfaithful 264 series, the software was by far better. The 96k of CMOS ROM contained the following software, some of which was incomplete in the prototype shown on the Winter CES:\n- wordprocessor and spreadsheet - both could be worked on using a split-screen display, with the spreadsheet supporting scrolling even in this split-screen format. The spreadsheet engineer stated that it will be faster at moving a thousand cells than Lotus 1-2-3 on an IBM PC.\n- Address manager and planner\n- Pocket calculator \n- Filemanager \n- Memo pad \n- Monitor \n- Terminal program \n- BASIC 3.6\nThe main menu offered a few utilities for copying from the internal RAM disk to an external drive, or for downloading over the built-in modem (which was also supported by the BASIC 3.6 by an OPEN statement) or the RS232 port.\nBoth memo pad and calculator (which had also hex and binary mode) could be invoked with a single keystroke at any time without interfering with the running program.\nThe BASIC 3.6 is - with the exception of a few commands which are useless for the CLCD, like COLOR - almost downward compatible with BASIC 7.0. It also supports high resolution graphic commands, just like the Plus\/4.\nThe terminal program is of use, indeed, since the CLCD has a built in 300bps auto answer\/auto-dial modem. Additionally, the C=LCD has a separate RS232C port, so there is no need to attach a userport-to-RS232C adapter for a 'real' serial port. Commodore also decided to integrate a standard centronics port; rather unusual (at least for that time) is the HP compatible barcode port.\nLacking a builtin floppy drive, the LCD came with a serial IEC port, which was compatible with all Commodore serial peripherals. Above that, Commodore showed prototypes of an external 3.5\" serial floppy drive, the 1561, which was also battery-powered.\nA prototypical battery-powered thermal transfer printer with an excellent NLQ image was produced, but didn't make it to the market, either.\nAlthough this laptop didn't have an external video output, Jeff Porter stated that his team was thinking about a cartridge for the C=LCD which provided 80 column display for an external video display, using the C128's video chip.\nHere is an article by Benn Dunnington, from Commodore Info magazine issue #6 (1985) about a CES coverage:\n<i>\"[snip]...Now I pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming (where's Herbie when you need him?): there before our eyes is a working model of a Commodore lap computer with a remarkably readable 80 column X 16 line liquid crystal display! I run ouer to a guy demonstrating one of these units to ask a few questions. He turns out to be Jeffrey Porter, one of the co-designers of the LCD (as it is called). We are surprised at how young and intelligent he looks (we have met 'project' types from Commodore before who would not necessarily fit\nthis description). While we take turns vigorously shaking his hand, Jeff explains that he is a former C-64 'hacker' like us, and was recruited by Comnodore to design \"the machine you'd want for yourself\". What a concept!\nWe stop to read our product sheets,[stop here and read your LCD press sheets] I take_ a close-up photo of the keyboard noticing that it is different from the one shown in the standard press photos in our kit. Jeff explains that the press kit photos are of early mock-ups, and that the close-fitting keys of the unit on display would be used in actual production. We agree that they have a nice feel, and look better than the earlier version.\nWe are slightly disappointed to learn that the LCD is not C-64 software-compatible, but are impressed with the extensive built-in software which looks much more professional than the PLUS\/4 built-ins. I knouw a lot of people that will be delighted with the built in MODEM and the on-board terminal software which can emulate both the DEC VT52 &amp; VT100 terminals. I mentally go over some of the other pluses: 5hrs. operation on 4 penlight batteries, only 5lbs. total\nweight, fits in my briefcase, compatible with all C-64 peripherals, expected price- under $500) I ask Jeff about some items not covered by the press\nmaterials; Is the 32K RAM expandable? Jeff thinks it will be, but doesn't say by how much; does the use of the 6502-compatible 65C102 processor mean that the\nLCD will be able to use Bill Plensch's fabled 65816 Superchip\" from Western Design Center [see 'News &amp; Views', iss. #5] ? a smile flickers over Jeff's\nlips, and his eyes go slightly out of focus as he replies simply, \"We're talking about it.\"\nWe also want to know more about the 3.5\" micro-floppy we see hooked up to the LCD. Al we can find out is that it is a \"Sony-compatible\" drive that hooks up to the serial port of any of the Conmodore computers (the peculiar thing is that, while other 3.5\" drives typically store 1\/2 to 1 full megabyte, we are told that this unit will only store a measly 170K- just like the 1541 ! \"Why\" was not explained).\"<\/i>\n____________\n<b>Bil Herd<\/b>, ex Commodore Engineer, reports  :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The LCD project had orders for over 15,000 units in place before it was cancelled. Apparently the Commodore executive who was responsible for this product (Marshall Smith) was convinced during a conversation with a Tandy (Radio Shack) executive that there was no future in LCD notebook computers.  Tandy, of course, went on to sell huge numbers of the model 100,102 and 200 LCD notebook computers!<\/font>",

        "description": "The \"TANDY Color Computer 3\" followed the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=508\">Color Computer 2<\/a>.\nThe CoCo3 came with 128K RAM, an analog RGB video port, enhanced 640x192 graphics capability, a 64-color palette and much more.  (All ports contained on the CoCo 1 and 2 models were also available on the CoCo3, e.g. RS-232 serial, cassette, right and left joystick and a 40-pin expansion slot.)\nThe built-in Language, named Disk Extended Color Basic 2.1, was a Microsoft BASIC with enhancements by Microware. It was similar to that of the CoCo2, but Microware added the commands\/functions to take advantage of the higher resolution graphics and text. \nThe CoCo3 was upgradeable to 512 KB RAM. (After-market RAM upgrades have gone as high as 8MB, with rumors that 16MB and 32MB RAM upgrades may also be possible).  A <b>Multi-Pak<\/b> (a 4-port bus expander) plugged into the Expansion Slot allowed use of controllers for floppy disk drives, hard drives (MFM, RLL, SCSI and now even IDE), multi-port true RS-232 devices, MIDI units and much much more.\n  \nAs its microprocessor was still an 8 bit (strange choice when <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Commodore<\/a> were using a 68000), it couldn't access simultaneously to the 128k (or 512k), and thus used several RAM banks which could be switched (as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=238\">Thomson TO8<\/a>, or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=288\">MSX 2<\/a> computers).\nUnlike the CoCo  and CoCo II the 3 had an interrupt controller. This did away with a lot of the timing loops used in its predecessors, and actually took some of the fun out of programming in Machine Language.  \nTandy made several prototypes of a Color Computer model IV but it was never released.\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> D.

        "description": "The COMX 35 is a computer designed and manufactured in Hong-Kong by COMX World Operations LTD. The computer is based on an RCA CDP-1802A processor running at 2.8 MHz. The machine contains a total of 35 kB of memory of which 32 kB can be used by the user.\nThis computer is quite oscbure, and little is known about its history, particularly in Honk-Kong.\nIt was desgined and manufactured in Hong Kong by <b>COMX WORLD OPERATIONS LIMITED<\/b>. It was also sold in Sweden by Noxon AB, and in the UK by ALSY Computers Ltd, but it is in the Netherlands that he had most success (at least for Europe concerns).\nThe company that imported the COMX-35 to the Netherlands, West Electronics, supplied almost all of COMX software for free and copyright-free (or for a small fee for tape, disc and \/ or shipping). West Electronics also hosted several homemade software competitions, resulting in the fact that most software found today for the COMX-35 are actually in dutch.\nThere is no graphic mode, but user definable characters can be used to simulate graphics. The sound features are poor as there is only one single channel beeper. You can hear it when pressing a key. The Basic is very simple, with not a lot of specific statements, since there is not much to play with...\nThe keyboard is said to be waterproof (can someone test that for us ?) and used goldplated contacts under the keys (if you've got one, you are rich :-)). There is a built-in joystick to the right of the keyboard (very easy to break), a bit like on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=227\">Spectravideo SV-318<\/a>. And just above it, is the power Led.\nDifferent hardware extensions were made available, including an expansion box allowing 4 extension cards to be connected simultaneous. Cards were available to connect floppy disk drives, printers (parallel, serial and thermal) and an 80 column monitor. A 32K RAM extension was available as well, however the additional RAM was not usable or supported by COMX BASIC.\nThe chosen CPU, the RCA CPD-1802, was also used in the RCA Studio 2 videogame system and a development\/hobby systems using Chip-8, like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=543\">Cosmac RCA VIP<\/a>. This 8-bit processor is still being manufactured in many forms, as it is radiation-resistant. It was also used as the heart of the Voyager, Viking and Galileo probes !\nThe COMX-35 is black but can also be found in a white case. This model is rarer than the black one.\nThe COMX-35 did have a successor: the <b>COMX-PC1<\/b>. This was just a COMX-35 in a different housing and better keyboard. This PC1 was also sold as the Savla PC1 in India!\nThe design of the COMX-35 is quite similar to the Pecom 64 and the Telmac 600, even the BASIC is based on the same code as these computers. All 3 were based on Quest Super BASIC.\nThe COMX Basic is interesting and has some original features such as TIME and TIMOUT functions. TIME(X) can be used to start a clock and when X units of time has elapsed, the TIMOUT Y is used to jump to a subroutine beginning with the line number Y. Pretty neat !!\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to www.homecomputermuseum.nl, ww.comxclub.hobby-site.com and www.emma02.hobby-site.com for some of the info.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=110\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It had almost all the same features as the 664, except the memory. Like the 664, only 42 Kb could be accessed, the upper 64 Kb were used as a RAM disk or to store data. It was sold with quite a good quality monitor (monochrome green or color) and a built-in 3\" floppy disk drive (2 x 180 KB). \nIt ran under Amsdos (the Amstrad Operating System) or under CP\/M 2.2 or CP\/M 3.0 (CP\/M +). The CP\/M 2.2 OS was bundled with DR Logo and CP\/M+ with GSX (the graphic extension of CP\/M). Like the CPC 664, the Amstrad CPC 6128 was almost fully compatible with the CPC 464. \nThe German version of the Amstrad (Schneider CPC 6128) had different \"real\" connectors instead of mainboard edge connectors. Norbert Unterberg reports that the main reason for this was that the original Amstrad did not pass the German \"FCC\" test because it was polluting its surroundings with electromagnetic waves, and the rules for that were much stricter in Germany. That's why the Schneider got real connectors and a metal housing inside.\nHowever, after \"Schneider Rundfunkwerke\" stopped selling the Amstrad CPC series\nof home computers and the PCW series of word-processors, Amstrad continued to sell the CPC under the Amstrad brand name in Germany.\nThe ROM was identical for all brands of Amstrad: Schneider, Orion, Awa,...\nLots of Amstrad or third-party peripherals could be added, among them:\n? 2nd 3\"\/3.5\"\/5.25\" FD  max 800k\n? 20MB Hard disk, 4x5MB\n? Max 252x16k EPROMS\n? Max RAM Installed 640k (576k in use)\n? RS-232 Interface, Modem\n? 3 key Mouse, Light Pen\n? Centronics Dot Matrix Printer\n? \"PC-Hormon\" MSDOS emulator...",

Early products were cards for the S-100 bus, as used by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=69\">Altair<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=389\">IMSAI<\/a> computers. \nThese computers were built around the S100 bus. The S100 BUS was a standard (also known under the name IEEE 696) for connection on Zilog Z80 or Intel 8080 processors. A lot of S100 cards were available for the Cromenco systems. \nFour Cromenco systems were available :\n- <a href=\"computer.asp?c=826\">System 0<\/a>: Z80 A + RAM 64 KB + 2 floppy disk drives (390 KB each),\n- <b>System I<\/b>: As system 0 + 1 hard disk (5 MB).\n- <b>System III<\/b>: Z80 CPU, Dual 8\" Persci electrically driven floppy drives, 64 KB RAM. It was S-100 bus, Multiuser, used MP\/M operating system.\nIn 1982, Cromemco also introduced the CS-1H system using a dual processor board (Motorola 68000 and Z80) and offering 16 MB of address space.\nFor the moment, we don't know exactly the specific features for the Systems II and IV.\nThese systems ran under Cromix (the Cromenco Unix version). They could run under CP\/M and CDOS too (CDOS is a CP\/M like operating system). Several languages were developped especially for these computers : Fortran IV or a 16 K Z80 Basic wich was given as \"one of the fastest and most capable. Full 14-digit precision\".",

        "description": "In conceiving the Professional 300 series, DEC designers decided that new machines must be able to perform several tasks at once, apply the same user interface, communicate efficiently and use the same software as Digital's popular microcomputers.\nThese personal computers were really desktop-sized versions of the PDP-11, one of Digital's popular minicomputer. Both models shared the PDP-11 instruction set and memory management. Both had an operating system based on Digital's RSX-11M+. For the user, this meant that software applications developped for more than 500,000 PDP-11 and VAX systems were candidat for easy migration to a desktop personal computer.\nThe members of DEC 300 Pro series were the <b>325<\/b> (two 5.25\" disk drives, 400 KB each, and 1 expansion slot), the <b>350<\/b> (one 5.25\" disk drive, 10 MB hard disk and 5 expansion slots) and the <b>380<\/b>.\nThe 325 and 350 used the F-11 CPU running at 13.33 MHz (the external clock actually ran at 26.66 MHz). The 380 used the J-11 CPU \nAbout the number of colours: the three planes gave 8 colors at one time by referencing an 8 entry palette.Each entry in the palette could be programmed for one of 256 colors (by setting RGB values).\nThe internal card cage had space for up to 6 options total, and the base 350 system with EBO used four. The base 380 system used two. A Z80 card was available and allowed to use CP\/M as the OS.\nThe operating systems which ran on it were P\/OS (which was a variation of RSX), RT-11 and a variation of Unix called Venix. P\/OS and Venix are freely available nowadays. RT-11 is still licensed software and is still being developed and maintained.\nThese systems were originally sold as standalone units, but were later incorporated into the VAX 8000 series as the system ?Console?\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Megan Gentry, Former RT-11 Developer, who helped us 'debug' this page ;-)\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=115\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>\n\t\n<\/font>",

It followed the example of the Osborne systems, its main competitors. But while most other transportable systems were powered by 8-bit microprocessors, the DOT used a \"powerful\" 16-bit Intel 8088.\nIt has a wide built-in 5 x 9\" green monochrome display which can display up to 1056 x 254 pixels or 132 x 25 characters. There are 256 characters from the original IBM PC character set for compatibility, as well as 256 more characters for double size displays. The DOT features a real time clock. One or two (depending models) 3.5'' Sony disk drives were mounted inside the system (287 KB each).\nAn optional Zilog Z80 expansion board allowing to run CP\/M 2.2 was also available.\nThere is also an optional thermal printer (160 cps) mounted on top of the monitor, which can print everything displayed on the screen. It can also be remotely operated through 1200 baud line. Here are the Printer characteristics :\n- Print method: Thermal, with a 5 x 10 dot matrix \n- Print speed: 160 characters per second bidirectional \n- Paper: 8 3\/4 \" wide, thermal paper; 150' or 100' roll with last 5' color coded \n- Line length (characters): 80\/132 columns, selectable \n- Automatic carriage return and line feed: At 81st or 137th column \n - Character spacing: Vertical - 6 lines per inch Horizontal 80 column: 10 . 7 characters\/inch 132 column: 18.4 characters\/inch \n- Graphics density: Vertical - 64 dots per inch Horizontal - 64 or 128 dots per inch \n- Paper feeds : friction drive, 30 line feeds per second\nThis is some of the software available: MS-DOS, CP\/M (optional), assembler, Basic, Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, C, macro-assembler, Pearl, Record Manager, terminal emulation (TTY, IBM 3101, 327x, 3780, VT100), mailing, Volkswriter (wordprocessor), Multiplan, Time Manager, Project Manager...",

        "description": "The Acorn Electron is basically a cut-down version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">Acorn BBC-B<\/a> with which it is partly compatible. After the success of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">BBC<\/a>, Acorn and founder Chris Cury wanted a product to compete with \"under ?200\" computers and especially with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Sinclair Spectrum<\/a>, its main threat. But sadly, Acorn failed to meet the demand for the new system, mainly because of production problems related to the large custom ULA at the heart of the Electron.\nThe next year (1984), Acorn decided to anticipate all these problems and focused on producing the Electron in vast numbers. But unfortunately, public demand and enthusiasm were on the wane, and despite an extensive ?4-million advertising campaign, a third of the Electrons that were built never made it to the shelves, leaving behind large stockpiles of components that had been paid for but were never used.  \nCompared to the BBC and its flexible connectivity, the Electron was quite basic with only one expansion port to play around with. Fortunately, Acorn quickly released the Plus 1 expansion offering two ROM cartridge slots, a parallel \/ centronics interface and a joystick connector. \nThe built-in Acorn Electron BASIC, largely derived from the famous BBC BASIC, was impressive with innovative features such as the ability to define real procedures with DEF PROC and ENDPROC, or the handling of error events (in 1983 !). There was even an OLD statement which would recover a program erased by NEW. A complete assembler language was also stored in the 32K ROM.  \nThe graphics capabilities were also quite impressive for a computer of this category. Text mode of up to 80 columns and a high resolution of up to 640 x 256 pixels with 2 colors. The custom ULA developed especially for the Electron handled the video display,  sound and I\/O communications! This was the real heart of the Electron.\nThe mechanical keyboard was very good. BASIC statements were printed on most of the keys, allowing users to type them in one go. A small amber LED placed on the left part of the keyboard indicated if you were in lowercase or uppercase mode. \nDespite being more powerful than the ZX Spectrum, the Electron didn't sell well and suffered from a lack of certain software.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=121\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

At that time, after launching the Osborne <a href=\"computer.asp?c=573\">Executive<\/a>, Osborne Corp. had serious financial problems.\nIt was an MSDOS based computer with a built-in modem. The keyboard had four 'icon' keys which called small programs located in ROM : the \"phone\" key called the communication software, the \"clock\" key called a calendar, the \"disk\" key booted the system and the \"calculator\" key called a small electronic calculator.\nThe LCD screen could display only 16 lines, so only a few MS-DOS programs could be used (the lower 9 lines were invisible). When it was conceived, the Encore had a 25 lines LCD screen, but the size was reduced to save production costs.\nMorrow Design Co. also licensed the technology from Vadem and released a improved machine called <b>Pivot<\/b>. Zenith, in turn, licensed the technology from Morrow and sold a similar machine featuring a 25-line CGA display, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=897\">Z-171<\/a>. \nOsborne's relationship with Vadem involved manufacturing and system support. Vadem engineers made extensive changes to the original version, mostly improving its IBM compatibility, which gave birth in 1985 to the <b>Osborne 3<\/b>, the last Osborne computer sold in USA.",

Also when running on a TV, the resolutions are different: True Color mode is 640x480 in PAL and 640x400 in NTSC. The other TV resolutions also have a difference of vertical resolution between PAL and NTSC: 200 or 400 lines in NTSC, 240 or 480 in PAL.\nNew interfaces were added too : an ADC 16bit 50 KHz and a DSP I\/O port. The videochip has also genlocking features.\nThe Falcon was sold with the single-task TOS operating system in ROM (4.04). It is the old Atari ST TOS with new functions to handle the DSP and the new graphic modes. The GUI was slightly enhanced with colored icons and 3D windows.\nHopefully a multi-task TOS - MultiTOS) was also delivered on disks. This multitasking system uses the MiNT kernel and an enhanced GUI. MiNT (which stands for MiNT is NOT TOS) is a multitasking Operating System with lot of Unix features. It was initially done by Eric Smith. It was bought later by Atari and became then \"MiNT is NOW TOS). Atari planned first to put it in ROM, but it was not finished and was shipped on disks.",

It could be used as a home computer but its maim purpose was to be used in French schools in connection with other computers, or as a small server thanks to its built-in 300-baud modem.\nThe system was composed of a backplane used as a backbone to connect various cards: CPU card (a 6808 with 2 KB VRAM), RAM card (56 KB), disk controller, I\/O card (keyboard and Parallel Centronics), acoustic modem, graphic card (with 24 KB VRAM).\nThe Goupil 2 was sold with a monochrome or color monitor, both could run simultaneously.\n<b>Fr?d?ric G.Marand<\/b> reports to us :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The standard configuration had 16k RAM and 12k Basic in ROM. This Basic was quite.... basic, as it didn't allow to do much things : all display access, apart from PRINT, was calling the BIOS. There were no peripheral apart from the keyboard and the screen. Only one standard interface : tape interface (that I never managed to use). On the other hand, there were a lot of options available, up to a network disk for 4 stations (Corvus Constellation).<\/font>",

The H-89 was sold in kit form, the Z-89 came assembled.\nIt originally came with 16 KB of memory, later versions provided up to 48KB on the main CPU board (in groups of 1 KB chips). Zenith and Heathkit offered a 16 KB expansion card ($120) for a total of 64 KB when using CP\/M.  \nThe system was identical to the <b>H-19<\/b> video terminal but had an additional CPU board between the CRT and the terminal board. (Really identical because Heath offered upgrade kits to convert an H-19 to an H-88\/H-89 computer).\nIt used hard sectored disks with a built-in card controller. Under either H-DOS or CP\/M, disk capacity was of 90 KB. Another model the <b>H-88<\/b> was identical to the H-89, but did not include the floppy drive or controller. It had a cassette port.\nA couple of years later, the <b>H\/Z-37<\/b> soft sectored controller and ROMS came out, then was replaced with a double 5.25\" floppy disk drive called <b>H\/Z-87<\/b> (102 KB, 250 ms). A double 8\" floppy disk drive called <b>H\/Z-47<\/b> (1 Mb each) and a hard disk called <b>H\/Z-67<\/b>, it contained one 10MB 8\" winchester drive and one 8\" floppy drive (like the one in the H\/Z-47).\nIt ran under <b>HDOS<\/b> or <b>CP\/M<\/b> (the operating system used 16 KB of RAM).\nHDOS was originally written for the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=134\">H-8<\/a>, it ran without modification on the '89. This was a single-user OS written by J. Gordon Letwin for Heath. It included a Basic interpreter and assembler.\nFor CP\/M, H\/Z wrote a custom BIOS in assembler that the new user could further customize for his specific hardware and assemble right on the machine.\nA version of <b>MP\/M<\/b> was also available for the system. \nA lot of extension boards were available for this computer including 64 KB memory boards, hard-disk controller cards, 3-port serial I\/O board, H19 terminal board, etc.\nA third party small upgrade card was also offered which doubled the processor speed to 4 Mhz.\nAn assembler\/debugger was given with the DOS. A paper tape reader was available as well. Microsoft has adapted its various programming languages (Basic, Fortran, Cobol) for this computer. Borland also offered a version of Turbo Pascal that worked great with the CP\/M. \n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Dennis<\/b> reports:\nThe base H-89 had no graphic modes, just 33 graphic characters. At least two different add-on boards were created that gave the H-89 bitmapped graphics capabilities, but I'm pretty sure they both required hardware modifications to tie them in to the terminal board - this was not a simple plug-in expansion card<\/font>",

The memory was divided in 4 banks of 64 KB, Which where divided in 16 KB. The first 16 KB was used for BIOS. The next 16 KB was used for MSX-Basic. The next two banks where \"free\", except for the last couples of bytes. You could switch banks by \"peeking\" at adress &amp;hFFFF.

The HB700f was the US version. I had a HBF700-D with a german keyboard.\n? The exact peek for games was poke -1,255. Which was irritating, because all other MSX's in Holland used Poke -1,170 (mostly Philips MSX's). On that peek the HB-700 rebooted, for every copied game the autoexec.bas had to be changed ;)\n? The 256 KB RAM was called <i>256 Memory Mapper<\/i>. It was built-in the HB-700, but you could buy a separate one as a cartridge.\n? The machine was supplied with a GUI, installed separatly from the disk. This Gui looked alot like the Atari and Apple GUI's.\n? The MSX-DOS was in ROM. Normal MSX's I've seen had MSX-dos on a disk. On this one you could switch to normal MSX-basic with a command.<\/font>\n<b>Manuel Bilderbeek<\/b> corrects and specifies: \n<font color=\"#666666\"> \n- MSX-DOS and other OS's are always loaded from disk, never from ROM except for a few rare Russian Yamaha machines that have CP\/M in ROM.\n- MSX-DOS can only handle 64kB RAM, because of the Z80 and CP\/M.\n- There's no such thing as 4 banks of 64kB RAM, unless the author means the physical RAM chips, but I don't know about that.\n- This machine contains indeed 256kB RAM, and as is the case with all MSX machines with more than 64kB, it uses the memory  mapper mechanism, which works with blocks of 16kB that can be switched.\n- Under MSX-BASIC operation, the lower 32kB of the Z80 addressing space have the BIOS and BASIC ROM switched in, as with all MSX machines.\n- Address 0xFFFF is not for switching banks but for selecting the secundary slot of that slot. And one does not PEEK there to do that, but one POKEs.\n- The POKE that is mentioned should be POKE -1, 255. Here -1 is the same as 0xFFFF. This is to select the sub slot (3) with the RAM (memory mapper) in slot 3. Some old\/bad software fails to select the RAM and hence this needs to be done from BASIC before loading. There's also a generic POKE to 0xFFFF to select the right subslot with the RAM that works on any MSX.\n- There never was a US version of this machine.\n- The 700F is the French version. The P is the PAL (international) version. D is the German version indeed.\n- Many external memory mapper cartridges to expand the RAM were sold.\nAs you can see, most of this info is also valid for many other MSX machines.\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The HP 150 was Hewlett Packard's attempt to produce a user friendly office computer. It is an MS-DOS based system, but is not IBM compatible. It made heavy use of function keys and the built in touch screen to attempt to produce easy to use software. The computer is built into the display unit with disk drives as external units.\nIt is the successor of the HP 120 (which runs under CP\/M). It uses the same screen and the same case as the HP 120. The keyboard was made in Singapour and the cathodic tube was from Matsushita. But the whole system was assembled in the US Sunnyvale and Corvallis factories, and in Grenoble (France).\nOne of its main interesting characteristic is its \"touch sensitive screen\" (a 9\" Sony screen). Actually, it's not a true touchscreen, there's a lot of infra red transmitters and receivers around the screen which detect the position of anything on the screen : a finger of course but a pencil too. The idea of the touch screen came from HP Grenoble, but the concept was developped in the USA.\nThe HP 150 uses a shell or interface program called the Personal Application Manager or PAM rather than the standard DOS command line shell. This allows the user to select installed applications from the screen. In addition there are utilities to install applications under PAM, format disks and configure peripheral devices.\nNotice that the HP 150, as the HP 120, uses 3.5\" floppy disks when all other computers used 5.25\" floppy disks. The first models used 270 KB disks, they were replaced with 720 KB floppy disks. \nIt was possible to insert a small thermic printer into the screen. It was a user installed upgrade. It functioned via internal connections, and would work either as a DOS printer, or direct from the screen for logging, etc. It printed on 80 columns and used a continuous roll of special paper. \nThe packing of the 150 was very robust. More than one was rolled down a stairway, then powered up as a demo !\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=139\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Hewlett Packard HP 9000 is the ancestor of the actual HP9000 station!\nThe RAM can be extended by blocks of 128 Kb. It is possible to add one or two processors (its power is then brought to 1.7 mips or 2.5 mips). It runs under HP-UX (Unix) and is sold with a database (image 9000), a 3D graphic program (graph 9000), as well as the BASIC, Pascal, FORTRAN and C programming languages.\nThere was a later variant with a 68010 processor that supported HP-UX (the HP version of Unix). It was called the 9836U. There were color versions of both, the 9836C and the 9836CU.\nMarks Simms reports that the system HP that was sold as the first 32-bit microcomputer was the 9020. It was based on HP's proprietary processor architecture. The 9020 was a desktop system, but was much larger than the 9836 and had only one floppy drive. It only ran HP-UX.\nAfter these products had been launched, HP decided to give the HP 9000 name to all its technical computers and the 9836 became the HP 9000 model 236 and the 9020 became the HP 9000 model 520. Add the series 300, 700 and 800 and the term HP 9000 becomes almost meaningless.\nThe Series 200 included the HP-9816, HP-9826, HP-9836, and HP-9836C. The HP-9836 was mainly used for CAE applications, and high-technology (of that time !) in general.\n<b>Alan Barrow<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The 9020 was HP's 32 bit workstation prior to the switch to motorola processors. The 9020 started like the 9836 as basic, but was quickly refocused to HP-UX. It then became the 9000 Series 500. The later 9030 and 9050 offered more expansion and utilized CIO bus cards later used in the first S800's. \nThe Series 500 was a true multi user unix environment and was used both in workstation and mini-computer type environment.\nOne more family note: some of the S200's unix executables would work on the Integral in character mode as well. In fact, they would also work on the S300's in 16 bit mode, I believe. HP did a good job of trying to maintain compatability via standards.<\/font>",

        "description": "The ITT 3030 is a modular system with several options available. The original CPU for example is a Z80A, but a 8086 CPU board was available...\nMore floppy disk drives and hard disks (5, 10 and 15 MB) can be added. The average access time of the hard-disks is 170ms, and the transfer rate 600 kb\/s.\nIt is also possible to add up to two 8\" disk drives in addition to the original 5''1\/4 disk-drives. They can be simple-sides\/simple-density (256k) and are thus compatible with the IBM 3740 format, or double-sided\/double-density (1024kb).\nTwo monitors were proposed. A greenich monochrome one (80 x 24), and a color one being able to display 512 x 512 pixels and 16 colors. But these monitors could also be replaced with a TV.\nThe ITT 3030 works under <b>CP\/M<\/b>, <b>MP\/M<\/b> or <b>BOS<\/b>. It was delivered with CP\/M and user documentations.\nThe following software were sold with the machine : CP\/M, Microsoft Basic 5.0, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal (UCSB), Mailmerge and Supersport. Were also available : Calcstar, Wordstar, Datastar and many professional software (for doctors for example).\nThe ITT-3030 was in fact conceived by Standard Electric Lorenz, a subsidiary of ITT RFA.\nAbout BOS operating system, <b>Ian Turner<\/b> (from U.K.) clarifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nBos was an independent company who created a truly 'portable' (between different types of computers) operating system and sofware. They specialised in accounting packages but the OS was quite excellent and the name was the acronym of \"Business Operating Software\". They were highly successful until the early 1990's when they were bought by an insurance company and slowly migrated into an accounts software company running under Unix.\nI was a major developer and reseller for them and was instrumental in the link between Bos and ITT, who offered Bos as a package with their systems. The company still exists.<\/font>\nMore information from <b>Thomas Bourke<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nBOS was originally developed by CAP Ltd who were *the* consulting company for IT in the 1970's - 80's - the eventually were taken over by a French Company with the resulting name of Cap Gemni Sogeti.\nAnyway, I digress, CAP didn't know what to do with BOS, so they effectively spun it of into a company called MPSL (Micro Process Software Ltd - if my memory serves).\nIt sold BOS and a bunch of horizontal packages (payroll, accounting, word processing, spreadsheet et al) both direct and through a series of dealers throughout the (english) speaking world.\nEventually MPSL (by now called BOS Software Ltd) was taken over by MISYS, a UK software\/ services company. MISYS ran a VAN (value added network) for Insurance Brokers, hence the confusion with insurance companies - but they did and do other things as well - mainly for financial organisations (but hey, they're big, so they do lots of things!).\nAn MBO bought the remaining pieces in March 1999 and TIS Software Ltd now owns BOS...<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=146\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It can also use RAM expansion \nmodules for the ZX 81 smaller than 64KB via a small adapter.\nIts most significant feature is its language: instead of using BASIC \nlike other computers, it uses the <b>FORTH<\/b> language (as did the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=142\">Hector HRX<\/a>).\nFORTH's advantages are that it's comprehensible, small, interactive,\nfast and extensible. It centers around writing procedures which operate \non objects on a FIFO stack, and is not as intuitive as BASIC. FORTH was \nthree to ten times faster than BASIC but was not as easy to learn.\nThis computer did not achieve significant success, probably due to its \nrelatively obscure language - as far as the general public was concerned.\nSteve Vickers wrote the ZX Spectrum manual - he has been an academic \nresearcher working most recently (2003) at Imperial College London, and \nthe Open University.",

The monitor works with the built in keypad and LEDs, or a terminal like the Teletype ASR33.\nIt is possible to connect the KIM to a terminal via a dedicated serial port.\nSoon after release, Commodore Business Machines would buy out MOS Technologies and distribute the KIM-1 with a Commodore name on it.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Bob Leedom<\/b> reports :\nThe KIM-1 had \"no video output\", you say?

As a result, tremendous ingenuity was unleashed by the KIM-1 User's Group, and the display was used for many clever things.\nThe editors published my version of the artificial intelligence board game (in which the computer learns which moves lose, and never makes those moves again, until it's eventually unbeatable), my baseball game (two-player or you vs computer, six kinds of pitches possible, scoreboard, men-on-base display, lots more), and my semi-successful commercial entry called KIM-venture (a tiny version of Adventure, with XYZZY-type secret word, monsters, treasures, 26 rooms, and more).\nIt was an amazing little computer.

        "description": "This computer was built at Meaux (France, Paris area) by Logabax which was owned by Olivetti at 65%. It was in fact the international version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=535\">Olivetti M24<\/a>.\nThis was a highly PC compatible system. It means that it was truely hardware and sotfware compatible with the IBM PC of the time. Back then, all \"PC compatible\" systems were not exactly 100% compatible... so it was a real marketing argument for the Persona 1600.\nThere were two true tests to know if a system was really IBM PC compatible: Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Flight Simulator, and the Persona 1600 was running both with no problem.\nBut in addition to its good compatibility, the Persona 1600 was offering more than the IBM PC itself: built-in RS232c and Centronics interface, more complete keyboard, better graphic possibilities (640 x 400) and 7 free expansion slots (instead of 3 for the IBM PC). Even the CPU (8086) was faster than the 8088 used by the IBM PC.\nIt was very well known in France because it was used as a server for Thomson TO7 and MO5 computer networks in schools (Nanor?seaux).\nIt ran under MS-DOS 2.11 or CP\/M 86.\nIt was possible to connect an optional hard disk (from 10 to 50 Mb).\nThe Persona 1600 was sold with a 12\" green monochrom, or a 14\" color monitor.",

It was a good machine but its main problem was a lack of software. Several models were available with 48 KB, 96 KB or 128 KB RAM, and it was possible to reach 192 KB with on-board RAM expansions! There is even a monitor in the Lynx's ROM which allowed the user to write and edit programs written in machine code. \nThe 96 KB and 128 KB versions featured 4 KB of additional ROM memory (mirrored twice for obscure reasons) with lots of extra commands for sound effects, such as laser and klaxon, and for using 24 KB of dedicated RAM as data space. \nThe Lynx Basic has really cool features, unseen on other systems of its category, like REPEAT-UNTIL and WHILE-WEND statements, and automatic indenting of procedures! The graphic possibilities were excellent, especially with the 128 KB model, and CP\/M could be used with the optional 5.25\" disk-drive and 96 KB or better models. \nHowever, the Lynx had no great success outside Great Britain.\nThe designer of the Lynx is John Shireff, an ex-drummer. \nSome hardware devices on the bus had potentially contentious outputs. This meant that you had to be quite brave if you wanted to program in assembly language - if you made a mistake, you could damage the hardware itself. This was highlighted in the user manual!\nCamputers ceased trading in 1984. Several companies expressed an interest in buying the business, and in November, 1984, a firm called Anston Technology took over. A re-launch was planned but never happened, and in June, 1986 Anston sold everything - hardware, design rights and thousands of cassettes - to the National Lynx User Group. The group planned to produce a Super-Lynx but was too busy supplying spares and technical information to owners of existing models, and the project never came into being.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: John J.

Its sound system was a limited version of the Apple II GS sound system. \nAlthough the SE-30 had a gray-scale monitor, the onboard video actually supported color. The cost of incorporating a 9\" color CRT would have made the machine far too pricey, resulting in the the grayscale CRT. However, the idea of a color CRT would be taken up again with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1043\">Colour Classic<\/a>. \nThe SE-30 also had an expansion slot that could support a variety of 3rd party cards, an example being a combination 10BaseT Ethernet \/ color video out card.",

        "description": "The Atari Mega STe is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=165\">Atari Mega STf<\/a>. It is an Atari STe with some features of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=245\">TT<\/a> (the case, the VME bus) and has a new version of TOS (2.05 and 2.06).\nIt has (like the Mega STf) a battery-backed up clock. The user can choose in the configuration panel the speed of the CPU (8 or 16 MHz) and can switch on or off a small memory cache. Thanks to these two features, the Mega STe was really faster than the STf. \nSome companies developed VME graphic cards for the Mega STe. This computer had less success than the Mega STf and was used as a publishing station or in music studios.\nA minor note: the Mega and TT gave a nod to the earlier integrated-keyboard ST series by adding a tongue-and-groove design element for loosely connecting the keyboard to the base of the CPU.\nThe Mega STe ended production in 1993. This was also one of the few Atari product to have an Appletalk networking port (or RS432)built-in. The TT030 was the first machine to have it and the Falcon also had one. Some models included hard drives, and some did not. The drives were usually shipped separately to the the dealers, and installed in the store. The internal hard-drives in the Atari Mega STE where SCSI, not IDE. A small internal SCSI adaptor board had to be installed for this feature.\nThe Mega STE was the fastest released official ST from Atari and included the VME bus from the TT030.  The bottom of the range Mega STE 1MB machine had an optional SCSI drive, though all other machines in the range came with SCSI as standard (At least here in the UK).  The maximum official RAM capacity was the same as the rest of the ST range at 4MB, though there were upgrades available from 3rd parties that took advantage of the 68000 address bus, allowing for up to 16MB to be added.\nThe Mega STE makes an excellent MIDI sequencer, and the LAN port can make use of early Apple Macintosh MIDI interfaces, so long as you are using Cubase and the latest version of MROS.\nThe Mega STE is also the only one of Atari's 'Professional' range of computers to have a TV modulator on the back, allowing it to be used if a monitor is not available.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n____________\nContributors: Steve Martin, Malcolm Ramage<\/font>",

It had about the same technical features but offered a typewriter keyboard, better display, enhanced text mode and a Parallel printer port.\nLike the MZ 80K and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=173\">MZ 80B<\/a>, it had no language in ROM. The disavantage was that user had to load a language from tape each time he switched the machine on, on the other hand, any language or machine code program could be loaded instead of the standard BASIC.\nThe MZ-80A was the last evolution of the all-in-one MZ-80 serie and the predecessor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=87\">MZ 700 serie<\/a>. It was sold in Japan under the name <b>SHARP MZ 1200<\/b>.",

It also featured an innovative 'Intelligent' cassette deck which was able to find and load a program anywhere in the cassette tape. All the cassette functions were remote controlled by software.\n \nThe MZ-80B was compatible with the other MZ 80x computers (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=172\">Sharp MZ 80A<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=174\">Sharp MZ 80K<\/a>), but unlike these ones, it was possible to have high graphic resolution thanks to one or two optional boards which provided one or two switchable graphic pages.\nThis computer, like all the computers of the Sharp MZ series, had no language in ROM, Basic (or any other language) had to be loaded from tape.",

Its name stands for \"M\" from MICRO and Z-80 from the computer it uses.\nIt has no language in ROM, and BASIC has to be loaded from tape. Sharp called this \"clean design\", as you could choose what you wanted to put in your computer, the MZ-80K being delivered clean... Though a 5.25\" floppy disk unit was later available, most people never used anything else than the built-in tape recorder (1200 bps).\nThere is no colour, no high resolution and characters sets can't be redefined. But the pre-defined characters set was very complete offering a lot of different graphical symbols, and people (mainly japanese) created great games, overcoming the main flaw of the MZ-80 serie... A graphic card was later designed for this computer, allowing to redefine the characters set resulting in a virtual \"high resolution\" of 320 x 192 pixels.\nThe MZ-80K is equiped with a real clock and a built-in speaker.\nFirst MZ-80K were sold in Japan as assembly kits (1978). In 1980, Sharp released the <b>MZ-80K2<\/b> which is basicaly a MZ-80K with 32 KB RAM, a non-reflective keyboard and and a volume control at the rear of the system. One year later, a cost reduced version, the <b>MZ-80K2e<\/b>, was marketed as an anniversay model when MZ serie sales reached one hundred thousand machines.",

        "description": "When the original Nascom company went into liquidation, the owner and a number of staff immediately set up Gemini in the next town. Gemini produced computer boards and systems using the same bus as the original Nascom. After some delay, the original Nascom operation was taken over by a division of Lucas Industries in 1981 (renamed Lucas Nascom), who developed the system and produced new boards and software.\nThe Nascom 3 was basically a cased version of the original Nascom 2, using the original Nascom 2 mother board, with space for fitting various expansion cards (disc drive interface, Advanced Video Controller, memory, etc).\nBoth CPM and NAS-DOS operating systems were available for disc users, though the original tape interface remained, and in its most basic form the machine could be used with this, and no disc drives. There was also a network system based on NAS-DOS.\nSince the bus of both the Nascom and Gemini systems was the same, it was not unusual for users to create hybrid systems - adding, for example, Gemini boards to their Nascom 3 or 2, or of course fitting Nascom boards into Gemini systems. Lucas designed and manufactured their own boards and systems, and indeed the Gemini and Nascom products were in competition in the market.\nThere was several software available: Nascal (Financial Modeller), Manor (Data Base Manager), Corplan (Business Modeller), Calcstar (Financial Modeller), Wordstar (Word Processor), FMS 81 (Data Base Manager), etc.\nThe Nascom III can accept Nascom II boards, and some new hardware: Hires colour graphics, 80 columns, single or double floppy drives (0.75 MB each), printer, etc.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Mike Hessey for the help.<\/font>",

There was no reset button and no ON\/OFF switch either. A third model, called <b>Newbrain M<\/b> included a battery-backup option (and the LCD screen) so it can be used as a handheld computer.\nAn expansion interface was available, providing 2 serial ports, 2 parallels, 1 DAC, 1 joystick port, and a light pen port.\nA network was also available and allowed to connect 24 computers together through RS-232\/V24 bidirectional serial ports.\nThe New Brain used a special management memory system which allows to expand memory up to 2 Mb (IMPRESSIVE!).\nThe character set contained 512 letters, numbers and graphics as well as VideoText symbols. The Character set was divided into two 256-character banks, only one of which could be selected at a time.\nAn optional VideoText module enabled NewBrains owners to access British TeleText and Prestel services\nIt could run under CP\/M. \n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=176\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

After the Amstrad <a href=\"computer.asp?c=84\">CPC 464<\/a>, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=112\">CPC 664<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=111\">CPC 6128<\/a> (three home computers based on the Z80) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=189\">PCW 8256<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=190\">PCW 9512<\/a> (both dedicated word processing computers based on the Z80 as well), Amstrad decided to make its first low-cost PC clone. It was a great European success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market (impressive now and phenomenal then).\nThis cheap computer was, however, complete and offered more than some others did. The small power supply (57 W) was integrated into the monitor.\nEight models were offered: The PC 1512 SD\/DD (with one or two 5.25\" floppy disk drives) and two models with hard disk (HD10 with 10 MB hard disk and HD20 with 20 MB hard disk). FD and HD versions could be acquired with a monochrome or colour monitor.\nThe Amstrad used an \"enhanced\" CGA graphic mode, which could display 640x200 pixels with 16 colors (or grayscale). It was sold with MS-DOS 3.2, DR-DOS plus 1.2 (an operating system from Digital Research), GEM (a graphic interface, also used in the Atari <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">ST<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=245\">TT<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"computer.asp?c=125\">Falcon<\/a>), GEMPAINT and GEM BASIC.\nThe mouse port, although using 9 pins like a COM port, is proprietary to Amstrad ... The port is female and is only for use with an Amstrad mouse. The special PC-CM monitor provides power to the system unit by a large 14-DIN connector.\n<b>Charles Da Silva<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nDigital Research brought all its support to the Amstrad PC with its DR-DOS, expecting it to know the same success as the CPC and PCW series. The problem is that, near to the launch, Sugar decided to also include MS-DOS, destroying all D.R. hopes to get even on Microsoft...\n<\/font>\n<b>Andrew Balls<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe PC-1512 was CGA-compatible software wise, but the display had a round DIN connector instead of 9-pin D and the signals were different: I vaguely recall that they were analogue instead of digital and perhaps had composite sync. It has been many, many years since I looked at these. The PC-1640 had proper TTL EGA on a 9-pin D.<\/font>\n<b>Rond Ofstad<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nOn the earliest versions of the 1512 model SD\/DD you could get a HardCard. It was a controller card with onboard 10 or 20 MB HD.<\/font>",

Third party modems were also available at 1200bps.\nA cartridge containing enhanced basic (with special graphics instructions) was also available.

        "description": "The Amstrad PCW 8256 was a dedicated word processing computer (PCW stands for Personal Computer Wordprocessor). It was supplied with everything necessary, the word processor, printer and dedicated keyboard (with Cut, Copy, Paste and Print keys). This model had great success because it was the first word-processing system available for such a low price. Once again Amstrad used the same principles with this professional computer as it did with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=84\">CPC-464<\/a> on the home-computer market. Two years later, 700 000 PCW systems had been sold!\nAll the hardware was located in the monitor case, as well as the 3\" floppy disk drive. An optional secondary disk drive could be added (360 kb\/side). There was only one power cord used for the printer, monitor and keyboard - it couldn?t be simpler. \nActually, the PCW was odd in that it has NO ROM. The boot sequence was loaded into the main CPU from the printer control ASIC and only had enough smarts to load and run the first sector from the floppy drive. \nThe printer was an Amstrad matrix printer (90 cps in draft mode and 20 cps in letter-quality mode), but it was not possible to connect another printer to the PCW. To use another printer, optional RS232 or Centronics interfaces were available. \nThe system was supplied with a word processor (on disk) developed by Locomotive Software (the company who made the BASIC language for the Amstrad <a href=\"computer.asp?c=84\">CPC series<\/a>) called LocoScript. Dr. Logo and a Basic called Mallard Basic were also delivered on disks (fun fact: Mallard is the name of an old train engine). This Basic was powerful and offered a lot of file-management capabilities. The Amstrad PCW-8256 was also delivered with CP\/M+. \nLocoscript was powerful but somewhat austere. You had to read 700 pages of documentation in order to master it. It used 154 Kb RAM, and the remaining 102 Kb could be used as a virtual disk. Each floppy disk, called a volume, could be divided in up to 8 sub-volumes. A particular page layout could be assigned to each of these sub-volumes. The system displayed text in an odd but useful 90 x 32 resolution. Of course as it was text-based software, you could not see exactly what would be printed (no WYSIWYG  here).  Another drawback was that it was not possible to link a document with an address book or a database, to generate multiple documents (this was to be corrected with LocoMail, LocoFile and LocoScript 2 a few years later). The 320k disks stored up to 90 pages of 2000 characters. \nIn Germany, the PCW series was called <b>Joyce<\/b>\nAnother PCW model was launched a few months later: the Amstrad <b>PCW 8512<\/b>. It has the same characteristics apart from having 512 Kb RAM to handle bigger documents, and two 3\" floppy disk drives. The top one is a single-sided, 40-track (180 Kbyte) drive, the bottom is a double-sided, 80-track (720 Kbyte) drive. 40-track disks could be read in the 80-track drive, but it's not advisable to write to them there because the 80-track drive has a narrower head. It had slightly darker plastic mouldings than the PCW-8256, grey instead of white. It was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=190\">Amstrad PCW 9512<\/a>.\nThe PCW systems were still used in 2000 by some people and a lot of CP\/M software is still available.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Andrew Ball, Allan Stirling<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=189\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was equiped with a 3\" 720k floppy disk drive (a second one could be added) and used a daisywheel printer instead of the dot matrix printer of the PCW 8256\/8512. \nLike the previous models, it could run CP\/M+ and was supplied with the Locoscript V2 word processor including LocoSpell and LocoMail, and Mallard Basic, both made by Locomotive software. DR Logo was also supplied as standard.\nIn 1991, two new models were produced :\n- A cut-down model called the <b>PcW 9256<\/b> (same characteristics, but only 256 KB RAM and a 3.5\" disk-drive) which was a replacement in the PCW range for the PCW-8256.\n- The <b>PcW-9512+<\/b> which replaced the PCW-9512.

        "description": "The Commodore PET 2001 was a very successful machine. Four models were made:  early 4KB models, the PET 2001-8N with 8 KB RAM, PET 2001-16N with 16 KB RAM and the PET 2001-32N with 32K RAM. This mchine was conceived by Chuck Peddle who later joined Tandon, a drive manufacturer.\nTrivia from <b>Dave Lundberg<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe static RAMs in the early 2001's got so hot that they would often \"crawl\" up out of their sockets over time.  The \"official\" solution?  Re-seat the chips and put a nylon wire tye under the socket and over the chip to hold it snuggly in place.\nMore trivia:  Microsoft \"quietly\" wrote the BASIC used in the 40-column PETs.  Proof?  Type:  <b>wait 6502, 10<\/b> and \"MICROSOFT!\" will be printed on the display 10 times.<\/font>\n<b>Guy Tailor<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">(99% sure this is true...). The following app will cause the Pet 2001 to catch fire!!!\n10 motor 1\n20 motor 0\n30 goto 10\nIt turns the tape motor on and off so quickly, it overheats and... flames!! :-)<\/font>\n<b>Alan R Morris<\/b> answers:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nGuy Tailor's report is probably untrue as it was generally known that it was impossible to damage the original PETs by any programming, including fast, (if fast is the right word) POKEs.  I've never heard of the keyword 'motor' in any of the 'toolkit' ROMs that I've used.\nEven flipping bit 3 of $E813 on and off, which would turn motor 1 on and off, would probably not cause it to catch fire.  Especially as the IRQ service routine would normally turn off the tape motors, unless the status flag for the cassette was poked to a non-zero value.<\/font>\n<b>Ian Callow<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nGuy Tailor's program actually relates to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">BBC Micro<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"computer.asp?c=121\">Acorn Electron<\/a>. The PET did not have a \"motor\" command. In any event, all it did on the BBC was burn out the motor relay.<\/font>\nMore details from <b>Frank Leonhardt<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nit's an 'urban myth' which was made up about the BBC Micro. However, it was based on a true story about the PET - there was a location you could poke to do with the graphics frequency which if you set it wrong could cause the HT supply in the monitor way over-voltage, which would sometimes break down the transformer. This came up in the PCW magazine* after someone wrote \"it is\nimpossible to damage a computer with bad software\".\n* Frank was the first Technical Editor for the famous <b>Personal Computer World<\/b> magazine, England's (Europe's) biggest computer magazine - founded in 1978.<\/font>\n<b>Alexander Pierson<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Chuck Peddle himself said that despite the official name, the Personal Electronic Transactor, is not what it is really named for.  From seeing the Pet Rock fad take off, Chuck thought \"if this guy can make 15 bucks or so from selling a rock, then if this computer is named like it, the PET should surely succeed.\"<\/font>",

        "description": "The PHC-25 was released at the same time as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1318\">PHC-10<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1319\">PHC-20<\/a>, in 1982. Sanyo wanted to offer a perfect line of products for computing initiation. These three models were supposed to be complementary. But despite high hopes, they just were flops and it's not clear if the PHC-10 and PHC-20 were even really sold, as very few were ever found. The PHC-25 was the only model of the line to have been sold with moderate success.\nPHC stands for \"Personal Home Computer\". The PHC-25 was the high-level system of the trio. It offered an extended version of the Sanyo Basic already found in the PHC-20, which itself was an evolution of the Tiny BASIC found in the PHC-10. Editing of the program lines is facilitated by the use of the orange arrow keys found at the top right of the keyboard.\nThe Sanyo BASIC V1.3 is stored in a 24KB ROM. The computer offers 16KB RAM  leaving only 14KB for the user to program in Basic or 8KB if the \"SCREEN 2\" option is chosen at startup. Indeed at startup a \"SCREEN ?\" prompt welcome the user. If you enter 1, it means you will just need one screen to be stored in RAM, leaving you almost all the RAM available for Basic programming. If you reply \"2\" at the SCREEN? prompt, then the computer reserves some RAM for a second virtual screen which could be used by the program.\nThe PHC-25 is powered by a NEC D780C microprocessor running at 4 MHz, which is compatible with the Zilog Z80A. The chip used for the video is the famous Motorola MC-6847 Video Display Generator, well known for its omnipresent green colored background, and also used in many systems of that time including the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=91\">TRS-80 Color Computer<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=117\">Dragon 32\/64<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=155\">Laser 200<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=163\">TRS-80 MC-10<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=177\">NEC PC-6000 series<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=80&gt;Acorn%20Atom&lt;\/a&gt;,%20&lt;a%20href=\" computer.asp>Philips VG5000<\/a>&gt; (used the Thomson EF9345 compatible chip) or the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=584\">APF Imagination Machine<\/a>, among others. Inside the plastic case, everything is arranged on two motherboards connected to each other through a ribbon cable.\nThis MC-6847 chip offers different text and graphic modes, each with a subset of colors available:\n- Mode 1: 16x32 (text) in 2 colors\n- Mode 2: 16x32 (text) in 4 colors and 64x48 (semi graphic) in 8 colors\n- Mode 3: 16x16 (text) in 8 colors and 128x192 (graphic) in 8 colors\n- Mode 4: 16x32 (text) in 2 colors and 256x192 (high resolution graphics) in 2 colors\nThe set of BASIC commands are:\nRUN, NEW, LIST, CSAVE, CLOAD, CLOAD?, CLEAR, CONT, EXEC, LLIST, DATA, DEFFN, DIM, END, FOR\uff5eNEXT, GOSUB\uff5eRETURN, GOTO, IF\uff5eTHEN, INPUT, INPUT#, KEY, LET, LPRINT, LCOPY, ON\uff5eGOSUB, ON\uff5eGOTO, OUT, POKE, PRINT, PRINT#, READ, REM, RESTORE, RETURN, STOP, SOUND, PLAY, CTON, CTOFF, ABS, COS, EXP, INT, LOG, RND, SGN, SIN, SQR, TAN, CSRLIN, POS, LPOS, PEEK, SPC, TAB, TIME, USR, POINT, FRE, CHR$, LEFT$, MID$, RIGHT$, ASC, LEN, VAL, INKEY$, STR$, STICK, STRIG, INP, SCREEN, COLOR, CONSOLE, CLS, LOCATE, PSET, PRESET, LINE, PAINT, SLOAD, SSAVE.\nThis is a very complete BASIC which is in fact compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=177\">NEC PC-6001 one<\/a>. Thus, the PHC-25 if virtually \"BASIC\" compatible with the 6001, but some instructions and features need to be modified before running the program. Curiously, it is not the only similarity between these two computers. The colors of the plastic case and keys are almost the same: beige and cream with grey and orange keys ! Alongside the BASIC compatibility, the electronic components are the same. Chances are it must have been intentional.\nStrangely enough, the computer looks like it was not entirely finished or if the designers lacked some space to implement all the features. Thus, you need to buy the famous PSG-01 expansion box if you want to have sound capabilities on your PHC-25. Crazy if you think that even the cheap PHC-10 had a internal buzzer to play with. Anyway, connect the PSG-01 box and you've got a real 3-voices synthesizer to play with. You even get two DB9 \"Atari compatible\" connectors to plug your favorite joysticks in order to play...\nWell, that is the main problem. The PHC-25 has maybe the worst ever choice of games available in the world ! Most of them are poor BASIC games, only INVASION (clone of SPACE INVADERS) being a real machine code game worth being played.\nToday, the Sanyo PHC-25 seems to be a rare machine. Very few were sold, and most of them were apparently distributed in France, hence most of the games found online are in french.",

        "description": "Among the Commodore news from the Summer CES 1984 was the renaming of the C=264 to Plus\/4. This renaming came along with a slight change in the built-in software: you could not choose between many different programs anymore, but each Plus\/4 was delivered with the 3-plus-1 software.\nThe built-in software is not worth the silicon it is etched in: a word processor (only with 40 columns and can manage documents with only 99 lines of 77 columns), a very small spreadsheet (only 17 columns and 50 lines), a poor graph generator program (which can graphically display data from the sheets, but only in text mode) and a small database (999 records with 17 fields each and only 38 characters by field).\nMost of these programs can only be used with a floppy drive. \nThe Plus\/4 can use some of the peripherals of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">C=64<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=252\">VIC-20<\/a>, like the famous MPS-801 dot-matrix printer and the 1541 Disk Drive run well with it but it can't use C=64 programs (unfortunately, it cannot use the same joysticks &amp; Datasette as the C=64\/VIC-20).\nThis machine wasn't built to be a competitor of the C=64, but it wasn?t meant to replace it either. It has an improved BASIC compared to the C=64?s, this one features graphic and sound instructions and a built-in assembler, but has lost lots of interesting C-64 features like great sound chip (SID: Sound Interface Device) or hardware sprites.\nThe Commodore Plus\/4 was an error in the Commodore marketing policy and had no success.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=194\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

The basic model has only 16k or 32k RAM and a Basic language built-in (Super-Basic). The 12\" monochrome monitor sold with it, could display 16 x 64 characters.\nThe Super Basic was 100% compatible with the one in the TRS-80 (only higher resolution with the graphics), and had some very neat additions like 8 different programs in memory that you could call between. In fact to get it run you had to have a bootstrap disk.\nA later model, refered as <b>SBS 8000A<\/b>, offers more memory (64k RAM) and can run CP\/M v2. Of course it is interesting if used with the optional drives (5.25\" FDD\/184k, 8\" FDD\/1,2Mb, or 12.5Mb HD). A large range of programming languages and software is then available : Pascal\/M, Cobol 80, Fortran, Basic 80, Macro 80, Mumps, Wordstar, etc. The monochrome monitor delivered with this model can display 80 x 24 characters.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Can you tell us more about the SBS 8000 ?<\/font>",

It can use the same game cartridges marketed for these consoles.\nThe SC3000 can't be used without a ROM cartridge, which can be either a game or language. There were three different BASIC cartridges. One came with only 1Kb of RAM (and you had only 512 bytes free !), the second with 16Kb and the last with 32Kb. In official adverts, they show a total RAM of 48Kb. This was counting the VRAM and the 32Kb BASIC cartridge...\nSeveral great games were adapted by Sega for this computer. Several graphic characteristics of the SC-3000 are fairly close to MSX ones. For example, it was one of the first computers to offer 32 sprites.\nSome months later, Sega released the <b>SC-3000 H<\/b> which was the same system but with a mechanical keyboard.\nThis computer was also marketed by Yeno under the same name (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=1096\">Yeno SC 3000 &amp; SC 3000H<\/a>).

        "description": "The Victor 9000 \/ Sirius S1 was conceived by Chuck Peddle who also designed the first Commodore PETs. This machine was quite innovative and superior in many points to the original IBM PC. It met a certain success in Europe as the IBM PC was not yet available there, whereas the Sirius S1 (european name of the Victor 9000) was. ACT sold a lot of these systems in UK, and their first \"homemade\" computer, the Apricot PC, borrowed a lot to the Sirius S1.\nThe mechanical keyboard is very complete and has its own 8035 cpu. The 12'' monochrome monitor is equiped with an anti-relflection filter and can be adjusted horizontaly and verticaly. Contrast and luminosity are controlled directly from the keyboard. The computer can display text ranging from 80 x 25 to 132 x 50. But the best feature is the high resolution reaching 800 x 400 pixels!\nThe Victor 9000 is equiped with a Codec which can sample and replay sounds in telephone quality. There are two V24 \/ RS232 ports and one parallel connector which can also be used as an IEEE-488 interface (to connect measurement instruments for example). There is also an optional light-pen, which is in fact a touch pen using resistive mesh on the CRT.\nThe two 5.25\" disk-drives are single-sided and offer 600 kb each. But double-sided models were available as an option and offered 1.2 Mb each.\nThe Victor 9000 was perhaps best known for how it was able to achieve such high density on it's floppy disks. It used variable speed disk drives; there were 9 different speeds used.  As the drive head moved outward the speed would increase.  It was really neat to hear the speed change as the drive head moved.\nThe Victor 9000 could run with MS-DOS or CP\/M 86. Many languages were available: Basic 86, C-Basic, Cobol, CIS-Cobol, Pascal, Fortran, PL1, PLM, etc.; as well as some software: Wordstar, Spellstar, Mailmerge, Multiplan, etc.\nFrom <b>Byte magazine<\/b> (11\/82):\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nVictor came to the computers competition much better prepared than most new entrants of the time. \nFirst of all, Victor was a subsidiary of Kidde Inc., a three billion dollar conglomerate.\nSecond, Victor had experience in designing and manufacturing microprocessor-based electronic products. The company had been making calculators for 60 years.\nThird, Victor had a great deal of experience in dealing with business people and the needs of contemporary office.\nFourth, The Victor 9000 distribution was supported by a network of 50 branch offices in the U.S.A.\nFifth and perhaps most important, the chief designer of Victor's machine is not a novice but Chuck Peddle, a founder of the microcomputer industry who knows how to bring maximum performance to the market at an affordable price.\n<\/font>\n<b>Andreas Tauscher<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">There is an additional user-port inside (this port is a complete 6522) the Computer. The disk drive has its own CPU, and was available as SS 360kB and later SS720kB and DS 1440kB! It used not a fixed RPM Speed, the Disk is separated in three zones with differnt speeds - Sound verry funny :)<\/font>\n<b>Grant MacDonald<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The variable speeds on the floppy drive were very distinctive and when I was at college there was a program available called \"Drive Music\" that accessed different sectors of the floppy to play tunes. We got into trouble for using it on the college machines.\nOn boot up it used the sound hardware to say (in an American voice) something like: \"I am the ACT Sirrius One, the number one choice in business computers.\"<\/font>\n<b>Michael Gillespie<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Andreas Tauscher is incorrect in his posting regarding disk capacity...the technical information listing is correct. Chuck achieved very high capacity diskettes through the use of constant bit-density. He did this on the Victor\/Sirius machine through variable speed drives but he had done it before on the Commodore products through variable clock rates.\nI was the first and largest Victor dealer in Canada and also created multiuser Concurrent SP\/M and multiuser Concurrent DOS for these machines. We introduced these products in London England the very day Victor went into chapter 11 !@#$%^&amp;*<\/font>",

        "description": "John Benfield, who worked on this computer reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">I redesigned the video card for Canada Computer when the SKS was imported into Canada. (there was a pretty nasty bunch of design flaws in the original card that would cause the driver transistors in the HV section to vaporize if you switched video modes too often). I also wrote lot of utilities for it and ported most of the BBS type software of the time (Modem7, Xmodem, RBBS, etc.).\nI think that SKS means \"Steinmetz Kunstliche Systemtechnik\" or something like that.\nThe available co-processors included a Motorola 68000 and an 80186. Neither were really marketed. I assume that they were all \"prototypes\" since the MSDOS was a bit dodgy. I never did see any OS that booted on the 68000, but it did make a nice little co-pro that you could use with your own code under CP\/M or Oasis (you had to link in a set of \"beta\" libraries to use it.). It was rumoured that the co-pro would support Xenix, but I never saw a running copy of it anywhere.\nThe text modes went from 40x12 up to 132x43 (though if you knew the architecture, you could essentially program the video controller to just about any geometry that you wanted to.)\nAll of the machines shipped with CP\/M and the PerfectOffice suite (PerfectCalc, Perfect Writer, Perfect Filer, etc.). Microsoft Basic only shipped with the 80186 co-pro and MSDOS package. It was an option with CP\/M.\nThe floppy controller was fully programmable and there were utilities to run it at 800K, 720K, 400K, 360K, 320K and 160K. With a bit of bit-tweaking, you could make it read just about any 5.25\" disk of the time.\nThere was an internal card cage that accepted a number of add-on cards (including the co-pros discussed earlier). There were also expansion slots on the motherboard for additional RS-232, parallel, RS-422 and IEEE-488 interfaces (though the IEEE-488 was a very specialized item that had to be ordered directly from SKS)\nThere was also a desktop version of this machine.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Sord M23 Mark III was available with 12\" green monitor or a 14\" color monitor.\nDespite the M23 featured a cartridge port, all of its important software came on floppies, including the ground-breaking PIPS-III and several BASIC compiler variants developed by Sord and running on their own OS. A lot of good business software and games were written with these.\nThere were later Mark systems released, including a Mark I with the world's first 3.5 inch floppies deployed, and the Mark V with eight inch drives -- the Mark III had 5.25'' floppies. There was also the Mark X with a 10MB hard drive.\nAround 1983 or so the \"M23EX\" was released - this was basically an M23 with the mk41 drives (5.25\" DSHD) housed in an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=218\">M68<\/a> case (more PC-style with separate keyboard and floppies in the main case).  It was a low cost option contemporary with the more expensive and better spec'd M68.\nGraphics required an upgrade - from memory it was a chip, and also an upgrade from \"FDOS\" to \"GDOS\" (the graphics DOS).  Graphics on this and the M68 were operated in a weird way from CBASIC or BASIC-II (a structured BASIC) - you put it into graphics mode and then issued specially formatted PRINT commands to access graphics - for example:\n10 PRINT CLEAR\n20 GRAPH 1\n30 PRINT \"GINIT\"\n40 PRINT \"COLOR 7\"\n... other code ....\n50 GRAPH 0\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Andrew Joll<\/font>",

        "description": "The Sorcerer II was the successor of the Sorcerer I (launched in 1978).\nThe computer used programs on 16KB ROM packs encased in 8-track tape cartridges. It shipped with Microsoft\nMBASIC and a development tools assembler \/ editor ROM pack. A word processor\nROM pack was also available.\nExidy initially provided an expansion chassis that would accept up to 6\nS-100 cards, and a Micropolis dual-disk quad-density 16-sector hard sector\nfloppy disk drive was available. These disks would hold up to 330kb of data\non a single side. A later version of the expansion chassis also included a\ngreen-screen monitor and two floppy drives, but may have held only 4 S-100\nslots. A standard serial port was available, but shared internal resources\nwith the keyboard which made baud rates higher than 300 a problem. The\nPennywhistle 300-baud modem was often provided with this machine.\nThe MECA digital \"intelligent\" tape drive could also be used and inserted into the Exidy monochrome monitor. (1 MB storage capacity, 8000 bauds transfer rate, file access in 10s, plugged into the parallel port)\n<b>Dutch CompuData<\/b> (CD) imported the Sorcerer into the European mainland. When sales in the US dropped because of the heavy competition in home computers market, Exidy Inc. stopped production of the Sorcerer. CompuData then produced the original Sorcerer in Holland in exactly the same outfit, but with the CompuData Systems Trademark for the European market. EXIDY Inc. of Richardson, Texas, finally closed the doors on March 26th 1982.\n_______________________\n<b>Brian Shoebridge<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe Exidy Sorcerer II was used in Australia by a few scientific and research people, like my father. Not many were sold as it was hugely expensive (&gt;AUD$3,000 1981) and no good for games (the best was \"Tank-Trap\"). Sorcerers here shipped with either 32k or 48k. As it used a standard cassette tape for data storage, volume control was always an issue when loading or saving. Disk drives cost as much again as the basic machine, but there was a urious \"stringy-floppy\" which was less expensive. I owned one for a year or two, and used it with a large Unisys greenscreen monitor unit i sourced from a mini-computer.<\/font>\n<b>Tim Bishop<\/b> specifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe sorcerer had better games than Tank Trap. (Though I fondly remember the game, playing it for hours when I was a kid, and would love to get a copy of the source code.) The graphics were quite good, with Chomp a Pac Man clone and Glaxians a Space Invaders clone. <\/font>\n<b>Alan Meyer<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I bought an Exidy Sorcerer II for $715 some time near the end of its sales life from a store that wanted to get rid of the last one it had.  My son, then aged 6, wrote his first program on the machine and played \"Arrows and Alleys\" for hours.  In addition to a 6.5KB MBASIC interpreter that was smaller and less functional than those found on Apple, Radio Shack, Atari or Commodore computers, a Forth compiler \/ interpreter was also available.  It produced programs that were intermediate in efficiency between Basic and assembler.\nTwo distinguishing features of the Sorcerer were the ROM cartridge port and the screen size.  It supported, IIRC, a 30 line by 64 column display.  The good part of that was that far more information could be displayed than in the competing systems.  The bad side was that a real video monitor was required.  A TV RF modulator would not produce readable text on screen.  The keyboard was also quite nice, as can be seen from the image.\nSorcerer sales were never very high and the manufacturers never had the money to get all the bugs out of the hardware and software.  Crashes and hardware failures seemed to me to be more common than on other machines - though that may have just been my experience.<\/font>",

It comes with a few built-in software (the 'IS' in 'IS-11' standed for 'Integrated Software'):\n- P.I.P.S is a spreadsheet which can hold 45000 characters. The calculation results can be represented as graphics through pie-charts or histograms. It is also possible to declare macros which will do your common operations. Files created with PIPS can be transmitted to other computers.\n- CALC is an intelligent calculator software which holds in memory all the operations for later reference.\n- while EDIT is a simple editor, WP is a real processor with block editing functions and justify functions.\n- COMM makes it possible to use the IS-11 as a terminal for another computer. You can thus consult databases, transfer files to or from the microcassette tape at a 9600 bauds rate.\n- there is also a tool to import files from Lotus-123, Wordstar or Supercalc to PIPS.\nAn orignal feature is that the microcassette recorder is used as a disk-drive ! Files are indexed on the tape so you don't to have know where there are on the tape. Of course it's a bit slow but a C30 tape can hold as much as 128kb.\nAbove the nice keyboard there are 6 functions keys which are used in most applications to navigate through the functions. To help you visualize these, F1 through F6 are written just below the screen.\nThere is a ROM cartridge slot which can be used to plug-in new applications or extra ROM memory (up to 128kb). These ROM cartridges can hold from 8kb to 64kb.\nCREATIVE COMPUTING wrote in September 85 :\n\"The operating system is so difficult to learn that by the time you get it down, the batteries run out.\"\nThe IS-11 was followed by the IS-11B and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=481\">IS-11c<\/a>.",

        "description": "The SORD M5 had no really great success outside Japan (and later Czechoslovakia) but had lot of interesting characteristics, very close to MSX computers released soon after. \nIts design was quite original. The machine xas quite small. The two-tone grey plastic casing opened to reveal a bright yellow back, which housed the ROM cartridge slot. The keyboard was similar to the rubber matting of the Spectrum, but felt markedly better. Most keys had a Basic keyword on them in small light-grey letters (available by holding down the function key as an other key is pressed). There was no full-size space-bar.\nThere was only 4K of internal RAM, but memory expansions were available. The joysticks simply plugged into tiny DIN sockets, and there was a port for a Centronics printer. The power supply was external and rather cumbersome. \nIt used a dedicated video chip (Texas Instrument 9918, 9928 or 9929, depending on the model) and had the same video characteristics as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX computers<\/a> (same graphic resolution, same number of colors, same number of sprites, etc.) but didn't belong to this family. The M-5 had 32 graphics symbols in ROM and could handle up to 32 sprites. Its sound chip was the Texas Instruments TI 76489, which wasn't MSX compliant. It had three independent sound channels which could produce a variety of music and synthesised sounds. The sound was sent through the TV speaker.\nSeveral cartidge based languages were available: the Basic-I (very simple version for beginners, delivered with the system), the Basic-G (with lot of graphic commands) and the Basic-F (for mathematic and scientific applications). The M-5 supported Inp and Out in Basic to control Z-80A ports, but had no obvious connector to the external world other than the ROM cartridge slot into which the Basic cartridge had to be be inserted. \nOne year later the <b>M5 Pro<\/b> and <b>M5 Jr<\/b> were released with a built-in power supply unit (and more RAM?).\n<b>Jan P. Naidr<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The Sord M5 was popular in Czechoslovakia because it was the first home computer on the common market. The other computers like Sinclair Spectrum have been imported individually from abroad. But you must understand the statement \"common market\". That was not common for everybody in the communist period. The name of the shop selling Sord was TUZEX. There was possible to pay only by dollars or any other hard currency or buy Tuzex Crowns (special voucher), which you could receive changing dollars in the bank. The solution for common people was to by Tuzex Crowns on the black market. 1 Tuzex Crown for 5 Czech Crowns. We are so happy the old times have gone.<\/font>\n<b>Jules Allen<\/b> (UK) adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">These machines were also available in the UK as Sord had a fairly decent presence in the business market. Sord's 'killer app' was PIPS III, essentially a programmable spreadsheet, and with a nod to this the M5 had a cartridge for a low end version called FALC. It didn't run PIPS formulas exactly so it wasn't a great deal of use.\nThe versions of BASIC were partially incompatible with each other which of course makes technical sense. But it didn't really help the cause and diluted the machine's appeal to hobbyists.\nThere were several game cartridges available as well. I can't remember if it came with the game controller or if they were an option. But they were pretty basic: They looked like an original iPod at first blush. There was a large, round 4-way pad in the center of the thing and a bright yellow button towards the top left. They sort of sucked to be honest!<\/font>",

        "description": "The Sinclair Spectrum +2 was the first Sinclair computer made by Amstrad after they bought the rights of the Sinclair computers products. Thus, it is not suprising that the Spectrum +2 is very similar in shape and functionality to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=84\">Amstrad CPC-464<\/a>. It was a kind of mix between the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=35\">Spectrum 128<\/a> and the CPC-464 !\nEven though it used several features of the CPC-464, such as the built-in tape recorder and a good full-stroke keyboard (at last!), it is above all an improved Spectrum 128. Thus, the sound chip used is still the well-known Yamaha AY-3-8912 which is the sound chip of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX computers<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=180\">Oric computers<\/a>,<a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari ST series<\/a>) and many other computers of the 80?s. It was the most popular sound chip at the time.\nAs on the Spectrum 128, two BASIC versions were implemented : the 48k BASIC to remain compatible with the original <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Sinclair Spectrum<\/a>, and the 128k BASIC which was already introduced with the Spectrum 128. There was still a calculator mode in the start-menu but the ? Tape tester ? option of the 128 had been removed since the tape-recorder was built-in.\nAs with the other 128k models, and due to the limitations of the Z80 CPU which can only address 65536 bytes, the 128kb RAM was not directly usable (unless with bank-switching routines), but could be used as a RAM disk.\nThere were several models of  the Spectrum +2 : the <b>Spectrum +2<\/b> (grey case) which had a motherboard nearly identical to that of the 128, and the <b>Spectrum +2A<\/b> and <b>+2B<\/b> (black case) which were simply Spectrum +3 computers with a tape-recorder instead of the disk drive. It means that their motherboards were quite similar to that of the +3. The difference between the +2A and +2B was mainly due to a move in production from Hong Kong to Taiwan.\nNote that the first ROMs developed by Amstrad for the +2 model caused compatibility problems with the old Spectrum software, so they changed a few things in later ROMs.\n\nWhen Amstrad conceived the +2A\/B and the +3 they redesigned the motherboard and made some internal changes on the bus. They also removed the keypad scanning routines of the Spectrum 128 and +2 (remember the keypad sold with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=35\">Spanish Spectrum 128k<\/a> ?).",

Indeed it has 3?? disk-drive built-in the right-hand side of the case and a ? real ? full-stroke keyboard, just like the CPC-6128.\nAfter the launch of the first Amstrad ? Sinclair computer ?, the Spectrum +2, they redesigned the motherboard and the content of the ROMs to produce the Spectrum +2A\/B and +3. They also made some internal changes on the bus and removed the keypad scanning routines of the Spectrum 128 and +2 (remember the keypad sold with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=35\">Spanish Spectrum 128k<\/a>).\nAs on the Spectrum +2, two BASIC versions are implemented : the 48k BASIC to remain compatible with the original <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Sinclair Spectrum<\/a>, and the 128k BASIC which was already introduced with the Spectrum 128. \nAs with the others 128k models, and due to the limitations of the Z80 CPU which can only address 65536 bytes, the 128kb RAM is not directly usable (unless with bank-switching routines), but can be used as a RAM disk (drive M :).\nSo, the big change is the built-in 3?? disk drive, exactly the same as the CPC-6128?s drive. The operating system is called +3DOS and was developed by Locomotive Software Ltd who also conceived the CPC Basics and OS. So, of course, the +3DOS is very close to the CPCs disk operating system. The Amstrad FD-1 external drive can even be used with the Spectrum +3 as a second disk drive by connecting it directly to \"DISK B PORT\" at the back of the system.\nThe Spectrum +3 is considered the ultimate Spectrum model, gathering all the good points of the previous spectrum machines : 128k, convenient full-stroke keyboard, 3?? built-in disk drive, 128k Basic, RAM disk, many interfaces... But sadly it was launched too late, at a time where the ST and the Amiga were already fighting on the shelves. It was the last official Sinclair Spectrum model ever made.

Two models were launched: one with 16 kb RAM and one with 48 kb RAM.\nOne of its most \"interesting\" characteristics is its keyboard! Some keys have more than five (!) functions! It is impossible to type BASIC keywords letter by letter, instead you have to use function keys. A lot of peripherals and programs were developed for this computer. It seems that several models of this computers were launched (at least 3), but I've no technical details about them. It was replaced in 1984 by the Spectrum + and in 1985 by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=35\">Spectrum 128<\/a>. \nAlan Wilson reports to us :\nThe 16K version of the computer had only the 16K ram chips loaded, while the 48K version had both banks full.\n    \nTo keep the prices down Sinclair used faulty 64K chips (internally 2 X 32K). All the chips in the 32K bank of RAM had to have the same half      of the 64K chips working. A link was fitted on the pcb in order to choose the first half or the second half. \nIt was possible with a few logic chips for the experimenter to have access to the faulty 32K bank.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=223\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Atari Stacy is the transportable version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=25\">Atari STf<\/a>.\nIt has a 9\" monochrome LCD screen which can only use the 640x400 graphic mode.\nThe other STF graphic modes can only be used with an external color monitor. It uses 12 small batteries and can be used for five hours.\nIt has the same internal SCSI interface as the Mega STe. Unfortunately it has no energy management. It was a bit big and heavy (more than 7 kg) and will be replaced with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=283\">Atari ST Book<\/a> few years after.\nThe Stacy was developed to use batteries, and the large block in the design on the right side below the display was set to hold 12 'D' cell batteries, but Atari soon found out that this arrangement could only power the Stacey for just a few minutes. Production units had this compartment empty, with no battery contacts inside. Later 3rd party companies would sell rechargeable battery packs (nickel-cadmium in those days) which could be used to make this a true laptop, but the run time was still poor.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n____________\nContributors: Steve Martin<\/font>",

        "description": "The SV-318 was launched in january 1983, at the Winter CES show in Las Vegas, as the same time as the Spectravideo CompuMate, an keyboard add-on for the Atari 2600.\nThe Spectravideo SV-318 is the system at the origin of the MSX standard, and such, has characteristics very close to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX systems<\/a> (same video, sprites, sound, I\/O, etc.). It was even sold as an MSX computer in some places, but it is not fully MSX compliant and can't use MSX programs. \nNotice that instead of using cursor keys, the Spectravideo uses a small joystick, which emulates cursor keys.\nAn \"expansion base\" addon was available. This provides 64 KB RAM, a 80 column video and a floppy disk controller and its floppy drive (5.25\"). With all these peripherals, the SV318 can run under CP\/M.\nIn 1984, Spectravideo released a revised version of the SV-318, named SV-318 MKII.  The colour of area around the keyboard is different, but more importantly the motherboard has been redesigned, for production costs reason. Among the changes was a single ULA chip instead of several TTL chips, reducing the motherboard footprint and cost. \nA more professional version of the SV318 was launched a while later: the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=228\">SV-328<\/a> (which has 80 KB RAM and a numeric keyboard and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=229\">SV-728<\/a> case).",

Its Microsoft Extended Basic was also close to the MSX Basic but not fully compatible. The cartridge slot couldn't use MSX cartridges. However, Coleco cartridges could run thanks to an optional card.\nThe SV-328 ran CP\/M 2.2 or 3.0 when connected to the 5.25\" 360 KB floppy drive unit. Several well known CP\/M software were adapted to the SV328; i.e. dBase II and WordStar.\nSeveral expansion devices were developed for this computer. Among them, the SV-605B expansion box which offered a 10 MB hard disk, two 5.25\" DSDD floppy drives, one Centronics port and six expansion slots.\nSome other peripherals were released: Graphic Tablet, 80-column card, 1200\/75 modem card, RS232 interface.",

But that's wrong, the first Spectravideo MSX is truly the SVI-728.\nThe SVI-728 is not really different from the other MSX 1, apart maybe from the keyboard which is very complete with its numeric keypad and also the fact that it was one of the first MSX to come with some serious extensions.\nSpectravideo also made a portable version of the SVI-728: the Spectravideo <a href=\"computer.asp?c=266\">SVI-738<\/a>.",

It was possible to connect up to 16 hard disks (140 MB max)!\nIt was sold with accounting software running an OS called Toshiba Business Basic which was different to the CPM OS with MBasic etc.\n_______________________\n<b>David Gimeno i Ayuso reports :<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe Toshiba T200 had 64KB RAM and 32KB ROM, which was copied to RAM after startup, so leaving only 32KB RAM available. Its size was around 60x40x40 cm. It may weight from 15 kg to 30 kg (or 66 lb) but not too much more because one young and not too strong man could carry it. And finally, its price in Spain for the 2 floppy system, was 666,000 pta (currently 4,002.74? or $4,962.20), including the WTZ80 printer. T200 floppies could use diskettes up to 640KB. They worked with double-sided, 80 tracks, 16 sectors of 256 bytes each. This printer was an 80 columns non-optimized printer (it printed moving its head side-to-side of the printing area, no matter how much characters it should print), 100 cps, tractor only and 10,12,17 pitches with corresponding 5, 6, 8.5 expanded pitches. And I'm thinking the paper tractor was both pull only and push'n'pull, but I'm unsure about that.<\/font>\n<b>Thomas Fusco's<\/b> memories:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI have very fond memories of this machine. I operated one of these at a small company in New Jersey from 1986 through 1989. Our unit was made in 1981. A sales rep later told us that the IBM PC rendered this machine (and many similar ones) obsolete, and it was discontinued soon after. The configuration was a bit different than listed on this page, comprising two 5 1\/4\" floppy drives employing single-sided, 360K diskettes with no hard drive. The computer booted from the left \"A\" drive (the failure of which finally retired the system to a dark corner of the warehouse where it may still be to this day). The printer that came with it was not the one pictured, but a Toshiba 1281 wide carriage daisy wheel, which, although quite noisy, produced great output. Each key was individually hard-wired so that the cable connecting the keyboard to the main unit was near the diameter of your thumb. When powered up, the green monochrome screen displayed C\/PM, but would boot a version of DOS from the A: floppy on which we ran WordStar. \nI remember the unit as weighing more than the 15kg (33 lbs) listed. The T200 had a big brother called the T250 that looked almost identical except it was significantly bigger, sporting a larger display and dual 8\" floppy drives (the literature I saw listed the T250's main unit weight at 135 lbs!). \nIn 1989, I placed a support call to Toshiba concerning some minor question. When I told the man what I had, he asked me to hold on for a moment, after which you could hear him yelling to others in the background, \"Hey, guess what this guy has? A T200!\" followed by a barrage of laughter. He returned and told me that mine was one of only about ten known in the world to still be in use (which made me quite proud), and referred me to an \"old-timer downstairs\" who might know something about this system (and who actually proved to be quite helpful).\nUp until the A: drive's demise, this machine ran absolutely flawlessly for the three years I used it, with not one problem or glitch ever....zero, zip, ziltch. Try that with a Wintel machine!<\/font>\n<b>Lorenzo Garcia<\/b> (from Spain) adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The Toshiba T200 was the first computer model that I used as a profesional computer programer. The T200 was fitted with an \"operating sistem \/ Basic interpreter\" called \"Business Basic\". Business Basic sintax included sentences to manage \"indexed files\". That feature was innovative at the time and very useful for business applications development.After a cuple of years, the IBM PC and clones phased out this supperb piece of techonolgie.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Tandy 100 was actually a computer made in Japan by Kyocera. All the ROM programs were written by Microsoft, and even a few of them were written by Bill Gates (!) himself ! These programs include a text editor, a telecommunication program, which uses the built-in modem (300 baud), and a rather good version of BASIC (no big surprise there).\nKyocera made this computer for three main companies: Tandy, Olivetti (Olivetti M10) and NEC (PC 8201), these computers are the same except the case and some little differences in the programs and a few physical differences.\nThe operating system uses 3130 bytes of the 8 KB RAM. So the 8 KB models (Catalog # 26-3801) didn?t sell very well. But there was also a 24 kb model (Catalog # 26-3802), and one year later, Tandy replaced the Tandy 100 with the Tandy 102 (which has 24 kb RAM too), and later with the Tandy 200 (1985).\nThe Tandy 102 is 1\/2 inch thinner and one pound weight different. The \"Date-Bug\" (random changing of the calendar) is also repaired from the Model 100. But many people still prefer the feel of the Model 100 as there are also more 100-only accessories on the used market than compatible accessories...\nThe CMOS CPU (80c85) allows to use the Tandy 100 for 20 hours with only 4 AA batteries (5 days at 4 hours\/day or 20 days at 1 hour\/day)!!\nThe model 100\/102 is still considered and used as an excellent machine, mainly to type texts when you're on the move (you can transfer them to modern computers) and even to send and receive emails !\nFun fact : its CPU was also used on the Mars Pathfinder probe's Sojourner rover !\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=233\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

There were actually 2 drives made by Tandy for the Model T computers. The TPDD held 100KB whereas the TPDD2 held 200KB. The TPDD2 could read the TPDD disks. They both used 720k floppies. A video interface was also available, it offered a new display resolution (80 columns X 24 lines) on any external video display unit.\nThe main competitor of the Tandy 200 was the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=198\">Epson PX-8<\/a>.

        "description": "The Texas Instrument <a href=\"computer.asp?c=236\">TI 99\/4A<\/a> was a very succesful computer. A large number ROM cartridges (36 KB each) were developped for this computer, as the popular Extended Basic.\nUp to seven peripherals could be connected : 32 KB RAM extension, RS232c, Disk controler (90 KB per disk, up to 3 disk-drives), speech synthetiser, Peripheral Expansion box, and so on... One item of note is that the bus architecture for the Peripheral Expansion box (PE) was the basis for the NuBus used in the later Macintosh computers.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b> : Stephen Boutillette<\/font>\n<b>Ben Yates<\/b> says :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The TI VDP had 16K of dedicated VRAM, outside of the CPU RAM memory map.\nThe 99\/4A has 4 VDP modes :\n1.

        "description": "The Compact Computer 40 is a cute little system which represents Texas-Instrument`s first entry into the portable computer market. It can be considered in many ways as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=236\">TI-99 4\/A<\/a>'s little brother.\nIt includes a special version of the TI Extended Basic, where most of the graphical and sound statements has been discarded. But it is so close, than some TI-99 4\/A can actually be executed on a CC40 !\nBasic statements can be accessed directly through specific key combinations (CTL + key). There is a reset button located to the right of the spacebar.\nA lot of peripherals were available thanks to the Hexbus connector : a printer\/plotter, a cheap and unreliable wafertape drive (a 8000 baud digital tape which can store about 48 kb) and an RS232c \/ Centronics interface.\nSeveral software were available on cartridge. Titles released by Texas Instruments include : Memo Processor, Mathmatics, Games #1, Finance, and Electrical Engineering. Memory could also be expanded through special cartridges.\nIn some ways, the CC40 is the ancestor of the Exelvision <a href=\"computer.asp?c=123\">EXL 100<\/a>. \n<b>David Vohs<\/b> report us :\n<font color=\"#666666\">Texas Instruments planned to launch later a TI <b>CC40+<\/b>, it has the same text and graphics modes and the same operating system as the TI CC 40. This model was announced after TI realized that their cheap wafertape drive turned out to be cheap but unreliable (no other method of mass storage was ever adapted for the TI CC 40). So the cool part about the CC40+ was that it had connectors for a regular tape player to be hooked up to it (just like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=236\">TI 99\/4 &amp; 4A<\/a>). It may also have sported a better keyboard (unconfirmed at this time).\nBut unfortunately, this computer was a casualty of bad planning, since TI was backing out of the computer market at this time, and the TI CC 40+ was never released.\n<\/font>",

Later they got US-typewriter Royal merged into it and had the best years between 1975 and 1988, when they even build competiting machines to IBM System \/34 and \/36 ... but they did neither understand nor learn the business and ran out of the financial power.\nThe technical part of TA is today a subsidary of Olivetti which tells it all about the downfall of TA. The operational part is a Holding in Nuremberg, which deals with offices, buildings and health-care.\nThe Alphatronic was mainly sold in Germany and was intended as a 'hybrid' Business \/ Home machine. For Business it was sold as either a 'dumb' Terminal or as a stand-alone Word Processor 'package' (consisting of base unit, WP Cartridge and (Centronics) printer.\nFor home the base unit had a 'built in' Basic ROM - it was also available with either a single or dual Floppy Disks (which included CP\/M and Disk basic).\nIt never sold very well in either market - it was much too expensive for home use.\nThanks to its Z80 CPU, the Alphatronic PC can run CP\/M and quite a few software packages available for it. There were two external disk-drives available: F1 and F2. F1 had the controller built-in. You had to have F1 to use F2, the second one.\nSometimes, the Alphatronic PC was sold as a complete wordprocessing package with a daisy-wheel printer (Triumph-Adler TR-170) and a word-processing cartridge inserted into the ROM-pack slot (top left part of the case).\nTowards the end of it's life, the British Company, MATMOS sold off the final 'batch' or single &amp; dual floppy packages together with a RGB-PAL convertor\n box.\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Steeve Buniak<\/font>",

It was launched a few time after the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=244\">Tandy TRS 80 model IV<\/a>. The Z80 processor was used for I\/O. Up to four hard disks could be connected (8.4 mb each). It was compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=243\">Tandy TRS 80 model II<\/a> thanks to the Z80 and could run the Model II operating system.\nThis 68000 chip set and associated memory were much more than a speed improvement.  It created a multi-user Unix-based system (actually Xenix, which was just a scaled down Unix).  Interestingly, Xenix was developed in part by Microsoft, it was probably the basis upon which some Unix-like functionalities were added to MS-DOS 2.0, like sub-directories, pipes and re-direction.\nThe 16\/6000 had a maximum memory capacity of 768K, and up to 9 serial ports for external terminals.  These limits were partly just physical, due to limited card slot space.  The 3-port serial cards had jumpers that would have allowed quite a few of them given an external card cage (never produced).\n  \nThe 768K memory limit was later bumped to 1 MB when 64K memory chips became available.  The original machine used a memory card of 256KB populated with 16K chips, and cables were available to support up to three cards.  With 64K chips only one card was needed to give 1 MB of memory.  Operating system limitations prevented using multiple 1 M cards to expand further in user memory space, but it was possible with software to utilize up to an additional 7 MB of memory as the system \"swapper\" which, given only 1 MB of user space, was almost always a source of performance loss if handled by the hard drive.\nThanks to <b>Mark Brumlik<\/b> for the main part of information.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=242\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

A small daugther card was supplied later to use a 32 MHz CPU, then all the TTs were shipped with a 32 MHz CPU.\nIt had a lot of extension connectors (like VME, VGA or SCSI) to allow it to be connected to a lot of standard peripherals.\nIt had also several features of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=24\">Atari STe<\/a>, like the sound system, but contrary to this one, it didn't have its enhanced video features (fine scrolling) and its Blitter (custom chip designed to move bitmap blocks).\nIt had, like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga computers<\/a>, a special memory organisation : 4 MB, expandable to 12 MB (called ST RAM) was used for coprocessors (video, sound, ASCI) and the rest (called TT RAM which can be located on the motherboard or on a VME card) was used only for 68030 processor and wasn't slowed by peripherals accesses. Both SCSI and serial could do DMA transfers directly to TT-RAM.\nA special version of the TT was designed to be a UNIX station, called TT\/X it was supplied with UNIX System V R4 and WISH (an extension of OSF Motif).\nHowever the TT and the TT\/X had no success and there was no (or so few) software especially designed for this computer.

The  \noriginal memory was 128 kilobytes with the ability to add a daughter card that would extend this to 256 kilobytes.\nThe Vector 4 had a much better graphics capability than the Vector III although I can't recall the resolution. The Vector 4 originally booted CP\/M and also had the LinkNet 750 kilobit\/sec token passing network card as an option.\nInterestingly enough by the time of Comdex in November of 1982 we had the LinkNet integrated to the extent that we could have 32 computers all linked together AND you could map ALL of the disk drives from the entire network onto whichever system you were working on.\nIn March of 1983 I did an install at Digital Research (inventors of CP\/M) of a networked system and between Vector and DRI we implemented CP\/M 86 that used the much faster 8088 CPU and had all of the same networking features that we had in CP\/M-80 as it became to be called.  If it had not been for some collusion between IBM and other parties, we would have had commonplace networking a decade before this actually happened....but that is another story!\n<b>Anthony Lefco<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">This computer had a hard sectored floppy. Later a soft sectored model became available so that it was more compatible with prevailing standards. It also had an option to convert to an 8086 chip through an installation by TRW. It came with a full suite of proprietary applications.\nThis was my first computer. I remember it well. It was murder to figure out how to get the data out when it was time to convert to a new computer as the company quickly went bankrupt, but it did force me to learn about computers in more detail.<\/font>",

        "description": "The French electronics magazine <b>Le Haut-Parleur<\/b> (The loudspeaker) published several articles about how to assemble the first modular computer based on the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. The author of the articles was Christian Tavernier, the computer was thus named \"Tavernier\". The operating system was Flex, also choosed by SMT Co. for its Goupil <a href=\"computer.asp?c=131\">II<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=132\">III<\/a> which were selected by the French Department of Education as small network servers.\nBut the Vegas was actually conceived in the editorial offices of another French Electronics magazine named <b>Microsyst?me<\/b> which published the schematics of this professionnal computer based on a single card holding all the nesessary components: 6809 CPU, 64 KB of RAM, 2 x Parallel Centronics I\/O, 2 x Serial RS232 I\/O, one SS30 expansion bus. The diagram of the computer took advantage of the application notes published by Motorola, about the 6809, 6821, 6850, 6840 and 6545 chips.\nIn 1983, the MICROKIT company started to sell the machine in kit form, it was a modern and professionnal computer that could be gradually enhanced.\nA 6545 chip managed the video interface, which could work in 80x24 or videotext mode (40x24). This mode was used in the French Minitel and TV Videotext. The same chip was used to manage this graphics mode in the last TV generation at the time. The VEGAS had no graphic mode. The display unit could be either a standard TV set or a monochrome composite monitor. The keyboard could be acquired separately. It was connected to one of the Parallel ports and used 8 data lines and one 'strobe' signal.\nSeveral 5.25\" or 8\" floppy disk drives could be used, from 360 KB to 1.2 MB (single or double-sided, single or double density). Up to 4 FDD could be connected in chain. To our knowledge, there were no hard disk connection because the card lacked a DMA port and the Flex OS didn't managed directories.\nThe sound output was a bit basic, only an square signal provided by a Motorola MC6840 with variable frequency, but no volume adjustment. \nIn the first Microsyst?me articles, several expansion card were promised: Enhanced video, EPROM programmer, synthesiser, etc. But most of the expansions were home assembled by anthousiasts who acquired the main board. A 512 x 512 video card was described in the magazine though, holding 64 KB of RAM and allowing image superimposition. It was connected to the Parallel port and seen by the system as a printer!\nThe main board held a simple hexadecimal monitor in ROM. Lots of programming languages were available under FLEX: several versions of Basic interpreters ands compilers, PASCAL, C, LISP, FORTH, etc. A spreadsheet, a word processor (Stylo) and a database management were also available. However, the Flex version of the Vegas wasn't compatible with the Tavernier and Goupil versions.\nThanks to <b>Jacques Rivet<\/b> for most of the information.",

        "description": "The VIC-20 ? a \"family\" version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=191\">PET series<\/a> (using the same microprocessor and Basic language) ? was the first computer to sell more than one million units.  Once dubbed the <b>MicroPET<\/b> during the 1980 Computer Electronics Show, it later became known as the VIC-20.  VIC referenced the <b>VIC-I<\/b> (Video Interface Chip) chip used for graphics and sound.  There does not seem to be any obvious rationale behind the usage of the number 20, other than the fact that it was close to the 22 characters per line and to the combined RAM and ROM memory in the machine (5 KB RAM + 16 KB ROM), or the total 8 KB Basic, 8 KB Kernel and 4 KB Character maps...\nRegarding the name, <b>Michael Tomczyk<\/b>, (manager of the VIC project) recalls:\n  \n\"<i>VIC sounded like a truck driver, so I insisted on attaching a number. I picked ?20? and when Jack Tramiel asked, ?Why 20??  I replied, ?because it's a friendly number and this has to be a friendly computer.<\/i>'  He agreed.  The number 20 has no relation to any technical feature -- just my idea of a friendly sounding number.  That sounds a bit bizarre looking back on it, but we did a lot of things by instinct in those days.\" \nThe VIC-20 was designed by <b>Bob Yannes<\/b> who also created the SID chip for the C64.  He later joined Ensoniq to design synthesizers. \nThe Video Interface Chip (or ?VIC? as it is commonly called), is one of the most important silicon chips in the VIC-20 microcomputer, coming second only to the 6502A microprocessor itself.  The VIC is a specially constructed input-output (I\/O) chip that offers a large variety of functions, but as suggested by its name, is primarily concerned with the production of the video output signal.  It was originally intended to be sold to third-party manufacturers for use in video game machines.  Demand for the chip was low, and so Commodore decided to make their own system to recoup their losses. \nThe VIC-20 was initially launched in Japan in late 1980 (under the ?<a href=\"computer.asp?c=1291\">VIC-1001<\/a>? name) with a Japanese 'Katakana' set of characters.  It was subsequently released in North America in May of 1981. Though these are the \"official\" release dates, several prototypes of the Commodore VIC-20 were reportedly available in late 1979.  These early machines offered only 4 KB of RAM and used a different set of game cartridges.\nThanks to the colorful graphics and low cost, the VIC-20 was an immediate success.  At its peak, more than 9000 units rolled off the assembly line each day.  Adding to its success was the fact that it was the first color computer to break the $300 (USD) price barrier. \nA wide range of peripherals and software were developed for the VIC-20.  The failed  <a href=\"computer.asp?c=97\">Commodore 16<\/a> eventually became the successor of the VIC-20. \n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Brian Bagnall, Rick Melick<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=252\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was designed as \na graphics display, accepting commands from any host through the Centronics or RS-232 port to fill the frame-buffer and drive the external monitor to the indicated resolution.\nMainframes to minicomputers to Macs and PC's were used to send graphic\ninfo to the VX 384. When the VX 384 was initially released, the PC graphics options were CGA or Hercules monochrome.\nA smaller model was launched a few time after : the VX128 (VRAM 128 KB and 8 color available per pixel).\nVectrix systems were used in a number of medical and manufacturing applications.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n<b>Peter Hildebrandt<\/b> reports:\nI was one of the software engineers on the Vectrix VX384.  \nThe VX384 was revolutionary in that it had vector 3D computer graphics algorithms built right into the ROM.  Commands could be issued to rotate, scale, and translate a model in 3D.  The vast majority of the firmware and the original conception for the device was done by Richard Katz, who founded the company in 1980. \nThe VX384 gets its name from the 384K of memory inside.  That allowed for an odd 9-bits of graphics display (512 colors).  A lower cost VX128 was also offered, but it only three planes of color (8 colors). Fewer of these were sold.\nLater, a dual IBM-PC graphics card version was developed for IBM (code-named the MIDAS project) with the same architecture and command set.  IBM eventually decided to use another company's design for their Professional Graphics Adapter.\nThe VX384 was also used as the basis of a television weather graphic system installed in about 50 television stations in 1985 and 1986.\nI wrote the Vectrix paint system for the IBM-PC called PaintPad.  It was hand coded in 8088 assembler.  Rock star Todd Rundgren wrote an Apple II paint program for the VX384 which was also sold by Vectrix.<\/font>",

        "description": "Wicat stands for World Institute for Computer Aided Training. The Wicat is one of the first (perhaps even the first) computer to use a Motorola MC68000 processor. \nIt is a card-based computer. The mainboard just houses the processor, the boot PROMs, a very fast cache memory and the glue electronics.\nA lot of cards were developed for this computer. Each card has its own CPU: The I\/O board called ICI board uses its own 68008 (68000 with 8 bit data bus), the FD &amp; HD controller, as the streamer controller uses also their own processor. \nApparently there were two versions, the 150-WS and the 150-WD, maybe for single drive and double drive... \nA number of these units were also sold in Australia and Singapore.\nMore information from <b>Mark Sullivan<\/b>:<font color=\"#666666\">\nI know all about the Wicat.  We still have one in production!\nThere were many models.  The 150 was the smallest and was soon obsoleted by the 1250 (12.5 MHz 68000).  The 1250, 1260 and 1255 were also Multibus-based but were towers and did not have an integrated terminal.  You used serial lines for the terminals.  There was a larger line that were based on a faster, proprietary bus but I never did use one of those.\nPeripheral options included a DEI cartridge tape drive, a QIC SCSI tape, and a Cipher open-reel 1\/2\" tape drive.\nThe machine was originally designed for computer-based training and, besides the monochrome console graphics, there was a color graphics system with a video-disc overlay.  There was an audio subsystem, called the Hydra because it had lots of cables, that was what we would call a \"sound card\" today.  A number (16?) of students had their own audio channels and this was part of the CBT system.\nThe proprietary OS was fantastic.  It was Unix-like but better integrated.  All the utilities shared a common set of options for file selection, etc.  The OS text editor was fully-featured, perhaps comparable to something like JOE today.  The editor had it's own virtual-memory scheme so you could edit files much larger than available system VM.\nAdd TCP\/IP networking and you'd have a pretty modern feature set.  Wicat had their own Ethernet network.  You could access disk files and even execute remote procedure calls over the network.\nWe ran a 3 user CAD system on the 1255 with a 12.5 MHz processor and 256K (that's right, I don't mean M) of RAM.\n<\/font>\nAbout the Hydra audio system, <b>Gary Dyer<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The audio subsystem called the Hydra allowed for 30 independent audio channels, for 30 independent student CBT sessions.  The Hydra keyboards, monitors, and audio channels had an unusual wiring system. It was based on either 7 or 8 units that were daisy chained together to a master card in the Main CPU unit. Multiple cards allowed for up to 30 students.  [Don't ask me why there is not a multiple of 8.  I believe there was an artifical limition placed by the software group that was being corrected when I left the company.] If a cable was not terminated correctly all 7 (or 8) units could fail. In practice this didn't happen very often.  Sabatoge by students was unusual. <\/font>\n<b>Brad Smith<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nA company owned by Lionel Singer (one-time 'shaker &amp; mover' in the Australian IT Industry) ported the Pick operating system to Wicat in the early-mid 1980's.\nI sold some of these to a Hospital in New Zealand around 1983 - for them to develop a ward-based patient tracking and costing system.\nI recall showing one of the small tower units at an Argricultural Trade Show - where the display hall was actually a large marquee.  We left it in there overnight, and when we came back the next morning it wouldn't boot - there was condensation from the frosty morning all over the boards.  I clearly remember removing each of the boards from the backplane, and drying them with a harirdryer!!  It then started up as normal!!\nAhh - the good old days...<\/font>",

        "description": "The Wren was one of the last \"laptop\" CP\/M computer. It can be described as a combined personal computer and Teletext terminal. It weights more than 12 Kg !\nThis Computer was assembled at the Thorn EMI factory in Treorchy South Wales. Only about 1000 were made before Wren went bust and many companys were left holding the parts for the other 9000 units that were part of the first production run. \nIt was very advanced for its day and the software package was very good quality and comprehensive for that era.\nAlthough the Wren computer was manufactured at Thorn EMI in Feltham, they were a subcontractor to Wren Computers Ltd.  Wren was a joint venture company between Transam Microsystems (www.transam.co.uk) and Prism (who distributed computers for Sinclair). Transam have recently been aquired by Eurodata Systems.\nThe Wren was sold with several good softs : Perfect Calc, Perfect Writer, Perfect Filer, Executive Desktop (agenda, phone directory, note-pad, etc.), the popular BBC Basic (the same as the Acorn BBC or the Electron) and a communication application. Indeed the Wren has a built-in modem and is Prestel (english videotex) compatible. But it can also be used to automaticaly dial phone numbers stored in a directory.\nThe whole system looks quite strong and robust. When transported, the whole monitor and drive assembly slides over the keyboard. The 7\" built-in screen is monochrome but it is also possible to connect the WREN to an external RGB monitor. The two disk-drives (40 tracks) can stored 190k each. Weird fact : the drives LEDs light up when one of the floppies is selected but don't light off when this drive stop to work...\nQuality control was a major issue which certainly delayed production and caused a few financial problems for Wren. It might just have been too far advanced a concept for the time....",

It also has additional hardware compared to the X1 serie: DMAC, CTC and SIO as standard. CTC &amp; SIO can be however implemented on X1 serie through additional FM sound board or Mouse\/Rs-232C board. But DMAC can not.\nTurbo series has a special \"KANJI\" V-RAM, compared to X1 series which has only one way to display \"KANJI\" symbols, a heavy task for the Z80A: to display 1 \"KANJI\" character, 96 bytes of data are transfered to the V-RAM. As opposed, Turbo series just send 3 bytes of data (2 bytes for shift JIS code, and another 1 byte for attribute) to the \"KANJI\" V-RAM. Among the 8-bit systems, only the X1 Turbo serie and MZ-2500 have this special V-RAM. The access time is almost null, compared to the X1's V-RAM which is slower.\nIn the same way, it takes from 2 to 8 seconds to define P.C.G (user generated characters, similar to sprites) with the X1 serie, while it takes only 0.5 seconds with the Turbo serie. The <a href=\"computer.asp?c=416\">MZ-2500<\/a> is also equiped with this feature.\nThere were in fact three models:\n- Model 10: built-in tape recorder, no KANJI ROM, only 48 KB V-RAM (additional 48 KB available as an option),\n- Model 20: one 5.25\" disk drive instead of the tape recorder,\n- Model 30: two 5.25\" disk drives",

        "description": "The Z-100 series professional systems were bi-processor computers. They used an 8-bit Intel 8085 to keep the CP\/M compatibility and thus run a wide range of professional software, and a 16-bit Intel 8088 to run MS-DOS or IBM PC\/DOS OS's\nTwo models were released: the <b>Z-110<\/b> (pictured) which could display color graphics and was delivered with monochrome or colour monitor, and the <b>Z-120<\/b> which had a built-in monochrome (green, amber or white) monitor.\nZ-Basic was the only language supported by Zenith directly. It was an extra-cost option on most packages. It could handle colors and graphics.\nThe professional keyboard was quite complete with 95 keys, a separate numeric keypad, 7 editing keys and 12 function keys. All the keys could be redefined by software. \nA wide range of expansions could be added to the Z-100. They came from Zenith directly, or from third companies, installed by dealers: one or two 1 MB 8\" disk drives, 5, 10 or 20 MB hard disk, 64 and 256 KB memory modules, expansion card with 6 x RS232 connectors, analogue\/digital conversion card, etc. The computer also had five S-100 bus connectors which offered a lot of possibilities. \nThe Z-100 was a very fast machine, one of the fastest in its category in fact. It was thus often used in a multi-user configurations, using Forth-Multix or Prologue operating systems.\nThe 8088 ran at 5 MHz initially, and then later at 8 MHz. The first boards could handle 192K RAM, but later boards could have up to (and use) 768K on the main board. The default Video RAM was 64K, but allowed 3 banks for up to 192K for full color.\nThe disk controller had support for four 5.25\" and four 8\" floppy drives, though OSs including CP\/M and Z-DOS supported only two of each. The earliest models (pictured here) had full height, but later models had half height drives. There was a hack later on that allowed for four 5.25\" drives under MS-DOS 2.x. A Winchester hard disk (5 or 10 MB) could also be connected.\nThese models were also available as the <b>Heathkit H-100 series<\/b>, sold then as kits.

The operating system, the editor and the Basic interpreter fit into the 4kb of the ROM !\nThe ZX-80 met some success with nearly 70.000 machines sold in less than one year, announcing the future success of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">ZX-81<\/a> and at the same time the birth of a new major actor in the micro-computers world : Sinclair Computers Ltd.",

        "description": "The Sinclair ZX 81 was the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=262\">ZX 80<\/a>, and can be regarded as an evolution of it.\nThe ZX80 could not handle floating point numbers or cassette data files, but the ZX-81 could. The ZX-80 had 4k ROM : the ZX-81 had 8K ROM with 30 additional functions and some instructions to drive the printer. Thanks to a higher level of integrations (the total number of chips in the basic system was 4, against the ZX80's 21), the ZX-81 cost ?30 less than the ZX-80. The plastic case was also different. Whereas the ZX-80 looked cheap in it lightweight white case, the ZX-81 was beautifully designed in its black ABS plastic case.\nThe keyboard was still formed by an underprinted plastic, but this one was made of non-reflective material. Even with this slight improvement it was quite horrible to use, that's why a lot of additional keyboards appeared quickly on the market. Some of the keys sported up to 5 functions, right in the Sinclair tradition, accessible through the \"GRAPHICS\", \"SHIFT\" and \"FUNCTION\" keys.\nHere are the functions added over the ZX-80 : ASN, ACS, ATN COS, EXP, INKEY$, PI, SGN, SIN SQR, INT, LEN, LN, TAN, VAL, =, , COPY, DIM A$, FAST, FOR ... TO ... STEP, LLIST, LLIST n, LPRINT, PAUSE, PLOT, PRINT AT, PRINT TAB, SCROLL, SLOW, UNPLOT. Some are quite useful and make you wonder how it was possible to make anything on the ZX-80 !? However, one function disappeared: TL$ which was used to return a string minus its first character.\nThe ZX-81 could be operated in two modes, SLOW and FAST. The FAST mode which was the only mode available on the ZX-80, only  refreshed the display when the system had completed computing, resulting in a painful screen flicker! It was a useful mode when you had to do a lot of calculation without the need to see what's going on all the time on the screen. The SLOW mode, which was indeed quite slooooowwww, behaved like all other computers did, refreshing the screen all the time.\nThe ZX81 contained only four main chips : the ROM, Z80A CPU, 1K RAM and the Ferranti custom-made chip! It is as simple as that. The machine was assembled by Timex Corporation in their Scottish plant.\nThis computer was a very great success in Europe in the beginning of the 80's. It was very cheap and a lot of people who now are working on modern PCs or Macs, made their first move on a ZX 81 even though its performance was actually poor! \nA very great range of peripherals were developed for this computer, among them : 3.5\" floppy disk units, keyboards, high resolution graphic cards, RS232 or Centronics interfaces, RAM expansions, etc... In fact, it was possible to make a pretty good computer from the ZX 81! \nThe range of expansion options was quite extraordinary. For instance, Memotech created a whole range of modules which would piggy-back, one after another (and using velcro pads to secure to each other and the to the ZX81, as there was no mechanical locking on the edge connector).\nSo, for instance, you could have additional memory (up to 128k!), high-resolution graphics, disc controllers, joystick controllers, serial ports, and so on.\nPopular add-ons also included replacement keyboards - one was a series of mechanical keys which stuck over the membrane keyboard, others involved re-housing the ZX81 inside a new, larger case with a \"proper\" keyboard.\nIn fact, the options were - seemingly - endless. Sadly the power supply wasn't particularly stable, so \"glitches\" were common, resulting in a system reset and the loss of hours of painstaking coding!\nIt was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX-Spectrum<\/a> and was also sold as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=477\">Timex Sinclair 1000<\/a> in the USA.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Silas Denyer<font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=263\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>\n\t\n<\/font><\/font>",

        "description": "In 1979, Apple had seen a need to complete the Apple II series. After a visit to the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) where he saw lots of new technologies (Ethernet network, GUI, OOP &amp; Laser Printers), Steve Jobs (then chairman of Apple) decided to launch a graphical computer. After lots of work (and two rejected prototypes along the way), the Lisa was revealed in January 1983.\nLisa was the original code-name. Supposedly, the Lisa was named after Steve Jobs' eldest daughter, Lisa Nicole. The Lisa project cost over $50 million and was the result of more than 200 person-years of research and development. It was supposed to be the Next Big Thing. It was not however the first personal computer to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Several Xerox systems developped in Palo Alto, utilized the STAR operating system. STAR contained a very innovative icon-based interface as well as a built-in word processor and calculator.\nContrary to the \"legend\", Lisa was not the ancestor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=271\">Macintosh<\/a>. Lisa and Macintosh were two distinct projects. The original Lisa couldn't use Macintosh programs and Macintosh couldn't run Lisa software. The LISA OS (Office System) was a true preemptive multitasking operating system.\nBut, because of its very high price ($9,999.99 USD in 1983!) and because of competition with the Macintosh, the Lisa was one of Apple's biggest flops (alongside the Apple 3 and the Newton!). A new version of the Lisa was presented in January 1984, the Lisa 2. It had virtually same features but used a 3.5\" 800 KB floppy drive instead of the old 5.25\" \"twiggy\" floppy drives.\nThree versions of the Lisa 2 were successively released:\n- <b>Lisa 2<\/b> basic version which had rather less memory (512 KB instead of 1 MB) and storage capability than the first Lisa,\n- <b>Lisa 2\/5<\/b>, the nearest to the Lisa 1 at approx. half the original price, was sold with a 5 MB 'Profile' hard disk unit,\n \n- <b>Lisa 2\/10<\/b>, which offered up to 10 MB of storage on an internal hard-disk.\nAll Lisa's were expandable systems thanks to three slots in the back, mainly used for RAM expansion cards. Up to 7 drives hooked up at once on the same interface.\nIn 1985, the Lisa lost its name and was renamed \"Macintosh XL\" (the Lisa 2 could become a Mac XL through the replacement of a ROM chip on the inside of the machine), its ROM and its display was modified to use the Macintosh Operating System and was presented as a development system for the Macintosh (Don't forget - in 1985 there was no hard disk available for the Macintosh). The Macintosh XL was sold until 1986 but became obsolete when the new \"True\" Macintoshes were launched (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=160\">Macintosh II<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=161\">Mac SE<\/a> in 1987).\nAfter the Mac Plus came out, all owners of Lisa's and previous Macintoshes\nwere offered the option to exchange their old computers for the new Plus\n(for a fee of course).",

        "description": "This computer was a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX 1<\/a> computer equipped with V9938 Video chip, which was quite unusual. It was probably meant to become an MSX 2, thus first versions were prepared to hold a CLOCK-IC chip. Thanks to its V9938 it could display 80-column text. \nIt was called SPECTRAVIDEO XPRESS because it was delivered with a bag to easily carry it around in. The XPRESS designation was also used in a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=288\">MSX 2<\/a> and PC hybrid (X'PRESS 16, for 16-bits) SPECTRAVIDEO computers. \nThis machine is in fact pretty much a \"MSX 1.5\". Converting it into an MSX2 machine is not difficult at all and as a result many MSX hobbyists have done it. For example in Finland, when it came out many people converted it simply because there were no MSX2 machines widely available in the country.\nThe main selling point was the ability to show 80-column text even on normal TV's without problems, you just had to adjust the colors a bit. It was also very well priced and had much better specs than the other machines in it's price range.\nBut the SVI 738 also has many quality problems like all SVI machines. The keyboard is just as bad as in the 328 and 728 computers. The original disk drive is noisy, unreliable and only single sided. The screw holes are not in standard locations, but other ways it can be replaced with standard DD disk drive. The first versions of disk ROM could not format 720KB \"PC-disks\" but reading works. Almost all MSX2 and up computers had internal disk drive, and it?s also possible to use external disk controllers with this machine. Disk expansion port for external drive has however nonstandard DB25 connector, just as the RS-232 connector (DB9 female).\nThe machine also suffers from the same problems (won't work at all or bad sound) as the earlier 728 model with Konami's SCC-sound chip games.\n___\nContributors : Taneli Lukka, Nyyrikki",

        "description": "The Texas Instruments TI 99 \/ 2 (in-house named \"Ground Squirrel\") was intended to compete in a lower price range than the TI 99\/4A (i.e. in the same range that the Sinclair Spectrum). But when the price war with Commodore forced TI to slash the price of a 99\/4A to that level, there was no market for the 99\/2 anymore.\nTherefore, this prototype never made it to the shelves of the computer shops.\n<b>Harry LittleJohn<\/b> and <b>Mark Jander<\/b>, the designers of the TI-99\/2, explained its concept in a Byte magazine article:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nWe beleived a major portion of our market would be first-time computer buyers looking for a minimal investment in the world of computers. We kept the price low to compete directly with low-priced computers such as the Timex\/Sinclair 1000.\nWe felt strongly that the first-time buyer must not be intimidated by the product. The console, we decided, must be simple and the keyboard must be no more complicated than a typewriter keyboard.\nTo ease the upward migration to more sophisticated computers, we decided to make our computer part of an integrated proct line basec on the 99\/4A.\nHaving identified these requirements, we selected the following characteristics for the TI-99\/2:\n<b>1<\/b> - A computer system for less than $100 including a minimum of 2 KB of RAM and 16 KB of ROM.\n<b>2<\/b> - A built-in, two-channel black-and-white RF modulator for connecting the system to a standard TV.\n<b>3<\/b> - A built-in interface for a standard audio-cassette recorder to provide economical mass-storage capability.\n<b>4<\/b> - A built-in Hex-bus interface to provide compatibility with the line of low-cost peripherals.\n<b>5<\/b> - An operating system that would be a subset of TI_99\/4A TI-BASIC. For cost reasons, the 99\/2 would not use the Graphic GROM of the 99\/4A and, therefore, 99\/4A cartridges would not be compatible with the 99\/2.\n<b>6<\/b> - No sound, color, or joystick capability would be supported again because of cost constraints.\n<b>7<\/b> - The full system bus structure would be available at an expansion port. This would facilitate memory-expanding Solid State Software cartridges or any other future system expansion.\n<b>8<\/b> - A nonintimidating 48-key typewriter-like keyboard with only two legends per key top. Lowercase letters would not be supported. \n<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=267\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

However, at TI they didn't think it\nwould generate any income, so it was never released.\nIt has built-in features which were optional in the 4A : The speech synthesiser and the Pascal UCSD ROM card. It is a prototype computer and was never marketed.\n_______________________\nVery interesting information from <b>CC Clarke<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nAs a young electronic technician at TI, I labored in the \"trenches\" during the Home Computer Wars of the early eighties.  It was brutal.  Our 99\/4A was technologically superior to the Comodore 64, but was marketed against the VIC 20 in price.\nThe 99\/8 (codenamed: <b>Roadrunner<\/b>) was supposed to remedy that situation.  It was more advanced, cheaper to produce, (the bottom line was ALWAYs the decisive factor in corporate decision-making) and used the existing TI HexBus interface, touted as the emerging interface standard at TI.\n  Unfortunately, TI got a very bloody nose when it voluntarily recalled thousands of 99\/4A AC transformers due to a perceived fusing issue.\nThousands of 99\/8s were built and warehoused (before being destroyed) after it was discovered they couldn't meet FCC EMI specs without expensive design changes.\nIn 1982\/83, TI was losing more money in their Lubbock Consumer Products Division than they could justify.  and the 99\/8's problems made it cheaper to bury than bring to market.

        "description": "The computer which caused the death of CP\/M computers.\nIn the early part of 1980, IBM decided to create a microcomputer (up to this date, IBM produced only mini and mainframes). They didn't really know that they wanted and they didn't think for one second that producing microcomputer was a profitable business (who would have thought!)!\nAfter hesitation between the Intel 8086 (16 bit) and the Motorola MC68000, they decided to use the Intel 8088 (8 - 16 bit) processor, as the two other ones were considered too powerful! Then they asked to Digital Research (the creators of CP\/M) to create an operating system for their new computer, as DR was not very interested, they then asked a small company (famous for its BASIC Programming Language) to write the operating system: Microsoft.\nMicrosoft wasn't capable of doing it, Bill Gates bought the rights to a small, hacked OS written by a small company called <a href=\"computer.asp?c=614\">Seattle Computer Products<\/a>: QDOS (which reportedly stood for \"Quick and Dirty Operating System\", which itself bears a striking resemblance to CP\/M) which became PC-DOS and then later MS-DOS!\nIn fact, when it was launched, three operating systems could run on the IBM-PC: PC-DOS, CPM-86, but also the UCSD D-PASCAL system.\nThe original IBM PC wasn't very powerful (and was certainly less powerful than lot of 8 bit computers at the time). The very first PC?s had only 16 KB RAM and no floppy disk units, they used cassettes to load &amp; store programs (notice that the commands to handle the cassette drives were present in the operating system all the way up to MS-DOS 5!). In fact, units could also be purchased from IBM with drives and more RAM.  Only the lowest cost version had no drives included (this is exactly how Apple and the other manufacturers did it as well).\nThe model 5150 was actually a success due to name and fame of IBM, high quality construction (especially the keyboard and monitor), great expandability and IBM's decision to publish complete technical specs.  The IBM PC Technical manual included circuit diagrams and the full source code for the BIOS! The PC 5150 became a standard and IBM ran the business computer market up to the end of the 80's.\nNow, we can consider that about 90% of the microcomputers are PC compatibles and run under MS-DOS or Windows (At the beginning, Windows was just a graphic interface for MS-DOS, but that?s another story). \nAlthough the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=286\">IBM PC XT<\/a> was launched in 1983, IBM continued production of both units, in various configurations, for several years. The model types were followed by a xx version number, i.e. 5150-xx, where the xx represented the included options (amount of RAM, single or dual floppy disk drive, etc.).\nJeffrey H. Ingber reports that when these computers (PC and XT) were initially sold, they were built-to-order computers (sounds like Gateway or Dell, doesn?t it?). Retail outlets would carry the factory products, which consisted of a boxed computer with basic components such as the motherboard, power supply, floppies &amp; floppy drives, etc.  There was no official base model configurations for the PC and XT.\nCustomers had a choice of RAM, display, serial ports, etc. that they could have installed on-site before the computer went home.\nOne could not purchase a \"new\" PC\/XT and run it out of the box becuase it was incomplete without additional configuration.\nThe PC was available with either CGA or MDA (on an MPA card). The CGA adapter actually has an RCA composite output to hook it up to your TV if you did not want the CGA monitor. The output quality was PERFECT! \nAnother notable great feature of the PC line was the expansion base: it added additional (I think it was eight) 8-bit slots in an external enclosure.",

The first one is located directly onto the system case. It has very small calculator type keys and is really painful to work with. In fact it is the same used with <a href=\"computer.asp?c=525\">MPF-1 Plus<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1204\">MPF-1\/65<\/a> educational computers. Knowing that it wouldn't be enough for the more ambitious MPF-II, Multitech chosed to deliver a larger keyboard with rubber keys, same type used on popular computers of that time like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Sinclair ZX Spectrum<\/a>. Even though it was better than the first one, it wasn't still very convenient. There is even a special key labeled with the Multitech logo which function is... nothing. Indeed, nothing happen when you press it!\nThe main interest of the MPF-II is that it is supposed to be compatible <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a>. In fact only its Basic is compatible with the Applesoft Basic. Thus it is not possible to directly use Apple Software on a MPF-II, even though later, special ROMs modified by enthusiasts were available to turn the MPF-II into a full Apple II compatible system...\nSome extensions were available:\n- up to 2 disk drives with their controller (5.25\", Single Sided - Double Density, 250 KB non formated),\n- Multitech thermal printer using special thermal paper (10 cm wide). 150 lines per minute, 120 caracters per second,\n- Dot matrix printer\n- joysticks, tape recorder, multi-printer interface.\nSeveral optional software provided the MPF-II with Assembly, Pascal, Logo and Forth programming languages.\nWhen it came out in 1982, the MPF-II had excellent reviews since for a reasonable price you had color, high resolution and 64 KB RAM. This offer had nearly no competition... until the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX Spectrum<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a> got more popular with their large software offer.\nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1204\">MPF-1\/65<\/a> also From Multitech is very similar to the MPF-II and might be based on it, or vice versa. The MPF-II had a successor, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=289\">MPF III<\/a>, also partially compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=83\">Apple IIe<\/a>.\n_______________________",

        "description": "What a mythical and powerful computer!! When Steve Jobs left Apple, he decided to create the best computer possible ! The result is the NeXT. \nThis prodigious computer impressed a lot of people when it was presented! Its technical features, its object oriented operating system and its graphical interface, even its black case were very far from the standards (remember how many black-cased computers there were in 1988: not many)! And NeXTStep is always considered as a reference.\nIt was sold with a lot of great programs and a very powerful 400 dpi laser printer. Some technical features were a bit strange (grayscale display, no floppy drive, no hard disk), but were modified in the next generation with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=555\">NeXT Station<\/a> and the NeXT Cube 040.\nNeXT also released later the <b>NeXTdimension<\/b> for the Cube. It is a board based on an intel860, wich offers a true 32bit Postcript color display and video sampling features. You could buy the NeXTdimension board alone or a NeXTcube upgraded with it, sometimes refered as \"color Cube\".\nUnfortunately, this computer was too expensive and had little commercial success, few years later, it was abandoned, but the later successors of this computer are still in use in some places, as servers! The NeXT was used as the world's first web server, and was also the platform for the first web browser!\nNotice that the architecture of this computer (68030, 68882 &amp; DSP 56001) is the same setup used in the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=125\">Atari Falcon<\/a> which was presented (a bit late) in 1992!\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/perso.wanadoo.fr\/fabrice.montupet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Computers Forever1970..80..90<\/a> for most of the info.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=277\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Amstrad bought the rights to use the Sinclair name on computer products. However, while Sir Clive Sinclair (the creator of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=262\">ZX 80<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">ZX 81<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX Spectrum<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=199\">QL<\/a>) retained ownership of Sinclair Research, he couldn't use the Sinclair name. Sir Sinclair therefore created a new company called Cambridge Research, with the intention of realizing an old project, the Pandora Project. The result of this work was the Z88 (it was achieved in 1988). Sir Sinclair at the time thought it was a revolution and said that this computer would be one of the best commercial successes. Actually it was Clive Sinclair's last contribution to the computer world! \nThis small machine was quite powerful; its operating system could exceed the 64 KB limitation of the Z80 with a good memory manager. It could also divide the memory into 16 KB pages, so the RAM could be expanded up to 3 MB thanks to 2 expansion ports. RAM cartridges of 32 KB and 128 KB were available. It had a built-in EPROM programmer available on the 3rd expansion port, so data could be saved directly on 128 KB EPROMs. \nThe ROM contained a lot of software: Pipedream (spreadsheet, word processor and database), the Z80 version of the BBC Basic (the Basic of the BBC or Electron), a diary, a calendar, a clock, a conversion tool, a VT 52 terminal emulator, Filer (the file manager of the Operating System) and a utility to transfer data to a PC compatible via a RS232 link. This transfer utility exported text and spreadsheet files into Wordstar or Lotus 1-2-3 formats. \nIt's probably worth pointing out that BBC basic built into the Z88 also contains a machine code editor, which allows you to embed Z80 assembly language into your Z88 BBC Basic programs! This feature was used quite often for the 'extra speed' portions of programs. Of course, having the assembly language embedded inside your source code meant that the code was very portable, and all loaded in one go - no messy 'support files' for your application.\nJan M.L. Bosmans reported to us that the BBC Basic in the Z88, although very powerful, lacks an essential feature: there is neither an editor nor debugger! This means that mistakes in a line can only be corrected by typing the whole line again. While it's true that the BBC basic had no editor built in, but one of the first 'type in programs' in the BASIC section of the manual was a program you could enter (and save to battery backed memory) that provided a line editor feature! It was just a few lines of BBC Basic, and worked very well.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: John J. Diamond, Mark Wills<\/font>",

        "description": "The Husky Hunter is a very special computer as it was designed to work in all environments (Aluminum alloy case). It is a rugged field computer.\nIt has military characteristics : it is waterproof (against accidental immersion) and shock-proof, and its autonomy can exceeds 45 hours (the endurance time of 45 hours is only achieved with Alkaline batteries, with NiCd they only last about 16 hour). The british army was using some Husky-Hunters in 1983.\nIt was also quite used by doctors and scientists in Africa or poor countries, where you need resistant and autonomous computers.\nThe Husky-Hunter has several programs in ROM: a small NULL modem transfer program and a terminal emulator. It has a also communication-oriented Basic to handle the RS232 and the bar-code reader.\nIn fact most applications developped for the Husky-Hunter consisted of data entries and then transfer of this data to bigger computers. Hence the RS232 serial port on a standard 25 pin \"D\" connector. Communications could be done up to a 4800 asynchronous baud rate. There were a wide range of protocols supported, including the IBM 2780 fully synchronous implementation (handshaking: RTS, CTS, DTR, DSR, RI, CD all selectable from BASIC).\nThe built-in Basic is also very powerful with graphic statements (CIRCLE, LINE, etc.). It is possible to redefine the characters and even the function keys.\nAnother very interesting fact is that there is a real time clock, so that the time of the day is software accessible.\nPrograms and data can be stored indefinitely in the battery supported memory of the Husky-Hunter. There's even a file manager running under the DEMOS operating system (CP\/M compatible).\nThe Husky-Hunter can also be used to receive data from measurement systems and\/or bar-code reader.\nThe hunter completed his IBM friendly ability with built in EBCDIC translation.\nThe keyboard was completely 'soft' and customizable with poke's from BASIC. The Husky's manual embraces proudly 'full compatibility with CP\/M programs for z80 and 8080 procesors.\nThe Hunter was not the first model. The first <a href=\"computer.asp?c=471\">Husky<\/a>, released in 1981, was a bit less powerful, had a LCD screen of only 32 x 4 characters and a flat membrane keyboard like the Sinclair ZX-81.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Jaume Vega<\/font>\n<b>Steve O'Hara-Smith<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I once got the opportunity to drop one from the balcony at Earls Court (empty stand below) - it was completely unaffected by the experience and was still running the program it had been running when I dropped it.

        "description": "The IBM PC XT is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a>. The XT stands for E<b>X<\/b>tended <b>T<\/b>echnology and was introduced in early 1983. It has enhanced features: CGA graphic card, hard disk, more memory, and no more tape port (!). But it wasn't very innovative.\nThere are in fact two versions of the XT motherboard. The first one can accept from 64k to 256k RAM, whereas the later one has support for 640K RAM max, the 101-key keyboard, a 3.5'' FDD and a few other details...\nIn addiditon to the removal of the cassette port, the XT also had eight 8-bit ISA expansion slots VS the PC's five. The XT's slots were also positioned closer together, the same spacing all PCs still use today. This made old PC's totally worthless because you couldn't buy an XT clone board and drop it into a PC case. Eight slots was a huge boon to the \"power user\" who had previously found himself having to pick and choose what upgrades to install in the paltry five slots of the PC.\nThe 5160 was replaced with the PC XT S (20 MB Hard disk, slim size floppy disk unit, 640 KB RAM), then with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=260\">PC XT 286<\/a>.\n<b>Richard Warr<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">This was the machine that launched my career as a software consultant. I spent months programming Supercalc II spreadsheets on a 128k model before we got the go-ahead to upgrade to a massive 256k and run Lotus 1-2-3!\nAlthough the original system board was supposed to take only 256k it was possible to overcome this by installing a multiplexer and soldering a couple of jumper cables, allowing use of 256k chips instead of 64k ones. I actually did this to a machine owned by General Electric and got the RAM up to 640k.\nWhen you did run out of slots you could buy an expansion unit which looked just the same as the base. As just about every function required a card this was often necessary.\nThere was a version of this machine called the 3270PC, especially designed to emulate a mainframe terminal. In 1985 I made a decision to buy a couple of these in preference to the new ATs. We'd never need the extra speed offered by a 6MHz machine(!). Fortunately I kept my job.<\/font>\nAbout expansion abilities, <b>Derek Brewer<\/b> specifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe IBM XT could, with the color monitor, be upgraded to the later EGA graphics card. The system can also, with a controller board upgrade and IBM DOS 3.30, be fitted with a 20-30Mb Hard Disk. The only limitation is when upgrading to EGA the system will only recognize a card with less than 32kb of VRAM.<\/font>",

Applied Technology had been previously producing kits in Australia for S-100 boards. The Microbee was released as a kit in 1982 on the cover of <b>Your Computer magazine<\/b>, the manual was included free with the magazine. They were an immediate hit, being quite a powerful little system given the cost.\n  \nApplied Technology eventually changed their name to Microbee Systems, and sold ready-made versions. Their main market (especially for the 32) were Australian schools, which had the Microbee recommended as the preferred system.\nOver the years there has been several versions of the Microbee 32. The early ones (PLUS series) had monochrome display and clock rate at 2 Mhz. Later ones (Colour\/IC series), from june 1983, included colour and 3.375 Mhz clock rate. \n<b>Different models:<\/b>\n- 32k Home built - 2mHz clock, Z80\n- 32k IC (with EDASM) - 3.375 mHz clock. All later Z80 Microbees would run at this speed though many were over clocked up to 6 mHz.\n- 32k Personal Communicator (with Basic, Telcom terminal program and Wordbee - a word processor in ROM)\n- 32k PC85 (Word processor, Basic, Spreadsheet, Database in ROM) - the last of the line for ROM based machines - very neat and with built in networking.\nThe Microbee 32 was followed by Microbee 56, 64 and 128 models. There were all disk based systems using CP\/M. The Microbee 128 was intended as a high-end business system. There were also two really keen prototype systems, the Gamma and the Delta, which were intended to compete with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amigas<\/a>, but problems within the company led to their cancellation not long before the company's collapse.",

The \/327 may also have had 128KB of DRAM on the motherboard (MPF-III computers do not have an Aux slot so cannot have memory added in this fashion).\nSlots 1-7 were configured like this:\n1 (virtual) Built-in Parallel Printer port - support for Epson, C-Itoh and CP-80 printers\n2 (external) accepts standard Apple II cards\n3 (virtual) Built-in 80 Column Card - Apple IIe compatible\n4 (internal) Reserved for optional Chinese Character Generator card\n5 (non-existent)\n6 (internal) Reserved for optional Floppy Disk Interface\n7 (internal) Reserved for optional Z-80 CP\/M card\nProDOS did not work (unpatched) on the MPF-III\/312 for two reasons:\n1) Apple put a test in the ProDOS initialization code that looks for the string APPLE in the monitor ROM. The MPF-III ROMs did not have this string. A one byte patch to the PRODOS file fixed this.\n2) The Apple IIe came in 3 memory configurations - 64KB, 65KB (with 80 column text card) and 128KB (with 64KB 80 column card). ProDOS checks for more than 1KB of Aux RAM and if it finds it, sets up a 64KB RAMdisk. The MPF-III\/312 has 66KB which ProDOS takes to be 128KB and attempts to create the \/RAM drive. Again, a simple patch to ProDOS fixes this.\nAn optional bus expander was released that plugged into Slot 2 on the right hand side of the unit plus a ribbon cable to a header at the rear of the to pick up the missing slotr select signals. This allowed up to 5 external cards (slots 2\/3\/4\/5\/7).\n_______________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b>: David Wilson<\/font>\n<b>Sergio Luvoni<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThis model was known as <b>Latindata MPF-III<\/b> in South America. Monitor had a green CRT. Because of a diferent memory map, it was not fully compatible with the Apple II. However, Apple's Z-80 expansion card worked and a double 5.25\" floppy drives unit was also available.<\/font>\nFurther information from <b>Mark Slabbert<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI purchased the MPF3 in 1984. Was a pleasure to work with. Most Apple software packages would work on it but some graphics related software would not. Had extra commands in Rom not found on Apple, i.e. Effect x which would generate sound  effects from the on board audio chip.\nNever gave me trouble although the keyboard had the habit of losing letters when cleaned. Excellent documentation included with computer. Sold it in 1988 in working order. Very compact casing but was still able to modify circuitry to drive external devices off data bus.\nFond memories.<\/font>",

New features include: a new PCM sound chip which can produce digitized sound up to 44 KHz (in assembly language) and a new Z80 downward compatible R800 processor. The user can select the CPU (Z80 or R800) by software.\nPanasonic was the only company to produce MSX 2 Turbo R systems: the FS A1. Two versions of the FS A1 were presented, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=775\">FS A1 ST<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=627\">FS A1 GT<\/a>. The GT has 512 KB RAM, a MIDI interface and MSX View in ROM (MSX View is the Graphic User Interface compatible with MSX-DOS).\nPanasonic stopped the production of the Turbo R when they launched the 3DO game system in 1992. They failed with this system and never returned to MSX.\nLot of extensions, however, were produced by third-party companies to enhance the Turbo R, among them, an OPL4 Sound Card, a hi-res card (Yamaha V9990) with lot of hardware sprites and IDE or SCSI interfaces.\n<b>David Heremans<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">There is a mixed mode where you can have +4096 colors\nsimultaneously with an extra 16 indexed colors so that still pictures in\nfull color can be displayed while the index palatte of 16 redefinable colors\ncan be used for all kind of effects.

It was mainly used for video production\/editing.\nThe european PX-7 was black whereas the japanese version was black and silver.\nA graphic tablet (PX-TB7) was also sold with the Palcom PX-7. With this thing you could create illustrations, shapes and various backgrounds, then store up to 8 of these shapes with their respective animation programmes into the computer memory.\nThe LD-700 Laser Disc Player was also sold as an option. When linked to the Palcom PX-7, the computer could entirely control it and exchange information.\nPionner also sold the ER-101 interface (Laser Vision) unit which made it possible for all MSX computers to have the same functionalities as the Palcom PX-7.",

Difficult to locate this computer in the Sharp family, it has some characteristics of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=415\">MZ 2000<\/a> but is not compatible with it.\nThe X1 family had a very great success in Japan, and the last models were very powerful. Go figure why Sharp didn't market these computers outside Japan? The most famous and strong feature of the X1 series is its Programmable Charactor Generator(PCG).\nTape Basic and Disk Basic were available but had to be loaded from tape. This is a concept that Sharp called \"Clean Computer\". X1 and MZ system (even X68000) do not have any Basic ROM or other OS ROM. They only have an \"IPL ROM\"(Initial Program Loader + IOCS) and a BIOS ROM. So if you want to use any OS with the X1 or MZ serie, you have to load it from external storage devices.\nSharp designed the X1 serie as an innovative multimedia system which could work with TV and video. The X1 serie has advanced features to display graphics and text over TV screens (superimpose feature). The X1 could achieve teletext functions without any additional peripherals (only the special X1 TV monitor which can be also used as a TV).\nSharp also released a \"color image board\" which was video capturing unit. Though it was working with 8 colours only, the result was astonishing for the time! The X1 was a real pionneer in multimedia market, but most people in Japan never realized this. The X68000 serie inherited from the X1 features.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Joe Repka reports :<\/b>\nBought one of these amazingly ahead-of-its-time computers when they first came out in Japan. First floppy device was a single-sided double-drive unit that cost 100,000 yen! SS floppy disks sold for about 1000 yen (USD 10.00) at that time.<\/font>",

Otherwise it is identical to the Z II.\nThe languages available were Hu-basic (developed by HUDSON soft), Turbo Basic and new Z-basic. The new Z basic language introduced enhanced functions (graphics and sound), but needed 128 KB RAM to operate. It was bundled with the Turbo ZII and ZIII, but Turbo Z owners had to buy it separately. An expansion memory board fitted with 64 KB RAM was then sold with the box, so Turbo Z systems could have 128 KB RAM.

The 8bit CPU (Z80) has reached its limits here.\nLike the X1 Turbo Z II, the Z III is VCCI compliant (electromagnetic emissions control) and has 128 KB RAM as standard, but does not have any remote connector for data recorder. Otherwise it is identical to the Z II.\nThe most famous and strong point of X1 series is the Programmable Charactor Generator(PCG).\nThe languages available were Hu-basic (developed by HUDSON soft), Turbo Basic and new Z-basic. The new Z basic language introduced enhanced functions (graphics and sound), but needed 128 KB RAM to operate. It was bundled with the Turbo ZII and ZIII, but Turbo Z owners had to buy it separately. An expansion memory board fitted with 64 KB RAM was then sold with the box, so Turbo Z systems could have 128 KB RAM. In fact you could add up to 256 KB RAM on this board, so Turbo Z owners could finally upgrade more easily their systems than ZII and ZIII ones.\nThe X68000 serie was launched one year earlier and finally, will replace the X1 serie.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=319\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Fujitsu was (and still is) japan's leading electronics company. This computer was the succesor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=377\">FM-8<\/a> itself first member of the Fujitsu FM (for \"Fujitsu Micro\") range of computers, extending from hobbyist home computers up to 16-bit machines for the business market.\nThe FM-7 was conceived as a cut-down version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=377\">FM-8<\/a>, eliminating the bubble cassette feature, and thereby achieving greater compactness and significantly lower price. But it also offered features not found on the FM-8, like a real sound synthesizer LSI providing 3 voices and 8 octaves. This made it the ideal hobby japanese computer at the time.\nAs the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=177\">NEC PC<\/a> series and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=313\">Sharp X1<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=298\">X68000<\/a>, these computers were very very popular in Japan. They all had impressive characteristics in relation to the European and American computers counterparts. \nThe Most outstanding feature of the FM-7 was the quality and speed of the graphic display.\nOn the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipsj.or.jp\/katsudou\/museum\/computer\/4050_e.html\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese Computer Museum<\/a>, one can read:\n<i>\"Later, it developed into the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=378\">FM-NEW7<\/a>, which used high-integration memory and gate array LSI to reduce price while maintaining FM-7 functionality, and a high-end machine called the <b>FM-77<\/b>. From the start, the FM-7\/77 series emphasized high-resolution color graphics and Japanese language display, and this trend continued with AV (Audio Visual) personal computers (beginning with the subsequent <a href=\"computer.asp?c=373\">FM-77 AV<\/a>) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=968\">FM TOWNS<\/a> hypermedia personal computer. The FM-7\/77 machines laid the groundwork for Fujitsu's later hobby machines.\"<\/i>\n<b>Nomura, Hisayuki<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nFujitsu FM 8 \/ 7 have a very unique feature. They have 2 CPUs. 1 for Main CPU (it's usual) and 1 for Graphics. Graphic CPU has their own boot ROM and main program. The Grapic CPU recieves request from Main CPU and draw pictures with their software. The two CPUs share small part of memory area and uses this shared area exclusively.\nAs another unique feature, the FM-7 can change its CPU. If optional Z-80A card is inserted, it can run CP\/M. In this case, memory is shared by the two different CPUs.<\/font>\n<b>Joerg Lemmer's<\/b> memories:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nWe had the FM7 as our first \"real computers\" in school. As the teachers had no understanding in computers at all they first bought the FM7 and then found out that there was no software available for them in Germany. So Z80-cards were bought and installed. By this a modified CP\/M could be used with just two applications: An early version of WordStar and TurboPascal. I am not sure, but I think there was dBase running on the FM7 later.\nOne teacher even started programming a library to use the outstanding grafic card of the FM 7 in TurboPascal.\nWe had FM 7 with single and dual external 5,25'', 170KB Diskdrives.<\/font>",

        "description": "The meaning of the name \"Galaksija\" is \"Galaxy\" and is pronounced \"Galaxiya\".\n\"Galaksija\" was a very important computer - not for its features but for the effect it had on the \"geek\" society at the time. It was named after the same-name monthly magazine dealing with various scientific issues (i.e. Yugoslav equivalent of \"Scientific American\").\nSometime in 1983, the editor, Dejan Ristanovic, decided to release a special (but separate) issue dedicated to computers: \"Racunari u vasoj kuci\" - \"Computers in your house\". This was the first truly computer magazine in the country. Due to amazing popularity it first became a regular bi-monthly and later a monthly issue.\nVoja Antonic heard about the plans to release the (first) special issue, contacted Dejan Ristanovic and the plans were made. It was originally thought that it will just be interesting to read but not really to make. Wrong: more than 8000 were made by enthusiasts (amazing number for such a small country).\nThe Galaksija was not envisioned as a *kit* but as a build-it-yourself computer (i.e. one did not have to purchase the kit at all, although kits were available) - so people made it themselves. Later on, some companies (such as \"Elektronika Inzenjering\" - Electronics Engineering) started making pre-built versions, mainly distributed to schools through \"Zavod za udzbenike i nastavna sredstva\" (Institute for textbooks and teaching aids).\nAn EPROM has to be sent to the authors to be programmed. The designs were found in the first issue of Racunari u vasoj kuci (which translates to \"Computers in your home\") magazine. There were 7000 kit complets sold and aproximately 10.000 made computers (including kit built ones).\nIt was a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">ZX81<\/a> class computer &amp; was invented by Voja Antonic. The Galaksija had an improved, optimised BASIC. Originally the Microsoft Basic was meant to be used, but in order to fit in 4KB of ROM, the improvements were done. Galaksija used only capital characters (like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=236\">TI-99\/4A<\/a>).\nThe computer was designed in second half of 1983. The diagrams were published in very late December 1983 in the January 1984 issue of magazine \"Racunari u vasoj kuci\" (special issue of magazine Galaksija). Technically speaking first Galaskijas were made in 1983 but only by the creators. All others were made in 1984 and later.\nRAM was a static RAM based on 6116 (2 KB) chips. The motherboard had three slots on-board to provide from 2 to 6 KB. Since first 8 KB were reserved for ROMs, RAM was expandable to max. 54 KB. Static RAM was chosen to simplify development although it was more expensive.\nThere is no VRAM. A part of RAM was used, read by the Z80A CPU which, in turn controlled the primitive video circuitry. Almost 75% of CPU time was used to generate the video signal but this made the computer a whole lot cheaper and easier to build.\nAbout the ROM, two sockets (\"A\" and \"B\") were available for 2732 EPROMs (4KB each). ROM \"A\" contained the basics (initialization, video generation, BASIC interpreter and alike). ROM \"B\" was optional and contained additional BASIC commands, assembler, monitor, etc.\nGalaksija only had a text mode (32x16). However, 64 semi-graphic characters  composed of 2x3 blocks combinations allowed PSEUDOgraphics to be drawn in 64x48 resolution.\nThe build-it-yoursef price varied significantly based on when and\n where parts were purchased. Pre-built model (significantly more expensive, from \"Zavod za udzbenike i nastavna sredstva\") used to be priced as follows\n(in 1984 currencies):\n- ROM A only, 4 KB of RAM: 45,500 din (approx. 447 USD)\n- ROM A only, 6 KB of RAM: 49,500 din (approx. 487 USD)\n- Both ROMs, 4 KB of RAM: 55,500 din (approx. 546 USD)\n- Both ROMs, 6 KB of RAM: 59,500 din (approx. 585 USD)\n<b>Galaksija Plus<\/b> was an improvement of regular Galaksija, created by different authors (hardware by Nenad Dunjic and software by software Milan Tadic). They added more RAM (48 K), more ROM (12K total) separate graphics mode (256x208). To reduce time it takes to save or load longer data (for large memory) the tape data recording speed was increased from 280 bps to 1200 bps. It was announced in the sixth issue (june\/jully 1985) of the same magazine, now simply called \"Racunari\" (Computers). Estimated price at that time was much higher, mainly due to very high inflation in the country - 140,000 din.\nThe author of this computer, Voja Antonic, reports us that the \"Glalksija\" was initialy offered as a \"do-it-yourself\" project in the 1st issue of the first computer magazine in (former) Yugoslavia, and there is a lot of interesting stuff about it. It was the time when hardly anybody knew what is the computer, so at the first moment he had the estimation of about 100 built samples, but he received over 7000 replies that readers built it and that they work !\nThe story has many more details, including broadcasting Galaksija programs over the radio (people would save the programs to the tape and then load them later, while other unsuspecting listeners would hear unimaginable noise).\n__________________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Aleksandar Susnjar<\/b> for most of the info !<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=330\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "What a weird computer !! Though it has a lot of similarities with other computers of that time, it seems to be however an original Brazilian production, a kind of mix between several popular systems.\nIts name MC-1000 is strangely close to <a href=\"computer.asp?c=163\">MC-10<\/a> from Tandy. It uses the same video-controller (Motorola MC-6847) but Sound chipset (GI AY-3-8910) and CPU (Z80A) are different. The character set is almost identical, but keyboard layout and Basic statements are not the same (PLOT vs SET, LOAD vs CLOAD, HOME vs CLS, etc.)\nMaybe the closest system would be the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=803\">Samsung SPC-1000<\/a>. It has the same CPU, Video processor and Sound processor ! But sadly nearly nothing is known about it... At first sight it doesn't look the same at all, but internaly there are very close.\nFinally it is also strangely similar to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=420\">Charlemagne \/ GEM-1000 \/ Junior Computer from GEM<\/a>, or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1328\">Rabbit RX83 computer<\/a> which seem to be the same computer... and indeed they are !\nA former CCE employee reports (<a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/ccemc1000\/historia\" target=\"_blank\">Source<\/a>) that the original design of the MC1000 was Chinese. A Chinese engineer\/representative came to Brazil to present the project to CCE. It was not presented as a final product already in production, but as a prototype. Some partnership was effectively established between CCE and the Chinese factory for the production of the MC1000. He was not reverse engineered. There was a lot of development: Hardware adaptations (for PAL-M, for example, or to adapt components), case, keyboard design, visual identity, packaging, software? The engineering staff worked many months to finalize the product. For the ROM, CCE received very little: just the dump and an assembly listing without comments...\n_____________\nThanks to Cesar Cardoso for the following information :\n<font color=\"#666666\">BACKGROUND ON HISTORY: from 1976 to 1990-1992, Brazil had a market reserve policy on microcomputers and selected computing items, i.e. only Brazilian companies could manufacture these items. But most companies only copied foreign computers and only a small part of it created their own technology, like Scopus and a MS-DOS clone called SISNE.\nThis little monster was a genuine Brazilian computer! CCE was a electronics manufacturer known for their low prices and low quality products. They released <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> and PC compatible machines, but developed their own computer, the MC-1000. Hardware-wise, it's close to a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX<\/a>, with some big project problems (the text mode, unsuitable for something more serious, and the printer port, which was external and sold separately).\nThe most heard word of this computer is \"vaporware\". CCE made a lot of them for this computer. The biggest of them all: disk drives. Hey, in 1985 disk drives was an essential peripheral of ANY computer - and CCE promised drives. Drives and CP\/M - MC-1000 could have been a decent CP\/M machine. They promised, promised... and never delivered. So people got tired of waiting and gave up on this computer.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=331\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "This professional computer from NEC was a very nice system at the time. With its high resolution graphics (640 x 475) and its large disk capacity (1 MB), it sure was impressive in 1982!\n<b>Bill Czermak<\/b> recalls:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I developed the first version of MIPS (Manufacturers Integrated Production System) on one of the first colour APCs sold in Australia.  I added a 5 Mb NEC harddisk later.  The 8\" floppies held 1.2 Mb.\nI am told my original system is in a museum in the Geelong area.\nI added an XT compatibility card to port my software to the the IBM XT and my software worked fine using this card.  When I installed it on a customer's genuine IBM, I got a blank screen!!!  Which I fixed that day on the customer's premesis.  I think the APC was 30% faster than the XT and cheaper with better graphics.<\/font>\n<b>Jeremiah S. Junken<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">I actually have one of these which still works. By default, it runs CPM\/86, there was a UNIX available, and MS-DOS available. Mine had an external 10MB HDD. The software included \"benchmark\" word processor, VisiCalc and dBase II.\nThe major things worth nothing about this otherwise unremarkable machine were it's relative speed, the fact that the lights would dim slightly when it was turned on, and that, in the year 2002, it still works. :-)<\/font>\n<b>Gary McCray<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI actually still have a working one of these also. Actually, it was pretty remarakable when it came out for its high resolution graphics capability using a (at the time) powerful NEC 7220 Graphics controller chip which formed the base strategy for virtually every other graphics controller since.\nUnfortunately very little software was available that took advantage of its graphics capability. Also it was featured in one of the stupidist full page ads ever produced and ran for months with a giant hand covering it up and the admonition \"The Computer The Competition Doesnt Want You to See\" and a suggestion to write away for information on it (see 'Adverts' section). If that wasn't stupid enough, you couldn't actually get any information on it from either writing or calling.\nIt is remarkably well made and was extremely powerful and reliable in the time it was built (weighs over 80 lb). But a combination of truly stupid advertising and lack of easy access doomed it in the US to a very small group. It fared much better in Japan understandably, and surprisingly in Australia (no giant hand I guess). I developed graphics authoring programs for it that sold successfully in both Japan and Australia.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=333\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Sheduled to be released in the U.S. in 1983 summertime, the PC-8201 was expected to compete directly with Tandy Model 100. Both machines were very similar, but the NEC could expand its internal RAM memory from 16 KB to 64 KB (only 32 KB for the Model 100). \nThe 8201's 32 KB ROM contained the operating system, Microsoft BASIC interpreter, a simple text-editing program and a telecommunication program. It could display the full 128 ASCII character set as well as Japanese Katakana characters and 61 user-definable characters.\nNec produced its own range of peripherals for the 8201, like a floppy disc controller (PC-8233) and various floppy drive units, including the most sold 3.5\" unit (PC-8031). A video monitor adapter (PC-8240), an acoustic modem and a bar-code reader were also available.\nSame hardware basis, made in fact by Kyocera, was also sold as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=233\">Tandy (TRS-80) Model 100<\/a> (USA), <a href=\"computer.asp?c=475\">Olivetti M10<\/a> (Europe), and Kyocera Keytronic (Asia).",

The keyboard slides underneath the main unit and locks into place. It was delivered along with a suite of standard software: word processor, data base and communications. \nAlthough it was significantly lighter and handy than the Compaq, the Hyperion suffered from reliabilty problems, specially from disk drives. Furthermore it was only 95% PC compatible. For these reasons, Compaq definitively took the lead of portable sales.\nThe Hyperion sales continued in Canada and USA for two year.

        "description": "The Sol Computer was developed by Bob Marsh, Lee Felsenstein and Gordon French. Bob founded his company, Processor Technology, in April 1975 making 4K RAM memory boards for the Altair (cause MITS couldn't make a working memory board)\nIn June 1975, Bob and Les Solomon (technical editor of Popular Electronics) dreamed up the Sol-20 computer, Bob had a bunch of cheap walnut that he originally intented to use in a digital clock, he didn't want it to go to waste and used it in the Sol-20 (see picture). \nAbout 10,000 of them were produced, some as kits, some as pre-builts. Based on the Intel 8080 microprocessor, this machine occupies a special niche in computer history for technical and esthetic reasons. It was one of the earliest to include a keyboard interface and support circuitry for full implementation of every 8080 function. It was a pioneer towards modern video output boards by having a design that actually put up alphanumeric characters on the screen, using a form of distributed processing that didn't lean on the CPU for all processing.\nThere were several models of the SOL-20 system : \n- The SOL System I ($1649 in kit or $2129 assembled), with SOL Operating System, 8 KB RAM, a 12\" TV\/Monitor, and a cassette recorder with BASIC software tape.\n- The SOL System II  ($1883 in kit or $2283 assembled), is a SOL System I with 16 KB.\n- The SOL System III ($4750 in kit or $5450 assembled), is a system II with 32 KB RAM, a video monitor, the HELIOS II Disk Memory System and a DISK BASIC floppy.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=344\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "All the MCM machines were designed and built in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The company was originally called \"Micro Computer Machines, Inc.\" (the term \"micro computer\" was all the rage in the early 70's) but sometime in the late 70's changed the name to simply \"MCM Computers\".\nMCM was among the first companies to fully recognize and act upon microprocessor technology's immense potential for developing a new generation of cost-effective computing systems.\nTheir first machine was launched in 1974 as the \"MCM\/70\".  It was a small desktop microcomputer designed to provide the APL programming language environment for business, scientific, and educational use. Since personal computers were pretty much unheard of at the time and since the company didn't have much money the launch didn't get a lot of notice. It was re-launched in 1975 or 1976 as the \"MCM\/700\" but this was purely a marketing game; the absolute sole difference between the 70 and the 700 was the additional zero on the model designation to the right of the plasma display.\nThe MCM 700 uses a full APL language interpreter and incorporates a battery backup system that automatically saves the user's workspace. It has an integrated plasma alphanumeric display, full 46 key input and a bus structure to allow interface to the other peripherals developed by MCM: Floppy Disk Drive, printer, plotter, card reader and a RS232 interface (called SCI 1200). At the time of release virtually the only external peripheral available (the plasma display and cassette tape drives were built in) was a Diablo daisy wheel printer. The additional peripherals were added over time.\nIn theory you could order models with zero, one or two cassette tape drives and with 2K, 4K or 8K of memory. In practice the 782 (8K, two drives) was the most common. There was no external operating system; when you pressed the ON button you went directly into the in-ROM APL which had all the facilities necessary to create programs and access all the peripherals, and allow virtual memory swapping on the two 100 KB built-in cassettes drives.\nThere were additional models released in due course:\n- <b><a href=\"computer.asp?c=1297\">Model 800<\/a><\/b> (faster cpu, RAM up to 16K, nicer looking case, CRT option)\n- <b>Model 900<\/b> (faster again, RAM up to 24K, CRT built-in)\n- <b>Model 1000<\/b>, aka \"MCM Power\" (repackaged 900, with optional HDS-10 external hard disk unit)\n_______\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributor:<\/b> Cam Farnell who worked at MCM from 1973 until 1981, starting as a junior assembly language programmer and ending as the manager of research &amp; development<\/font>",

        "description": "Thanks to <b>Michael Hoyle<\/b> for this information:\nThe HeadStart had two models. HeadStart <b>VPU<\/b> and HeadStart <b>ATS<\/b>.\nThe VPU was an impressive machine. It was a portable or a desktop machine.\nNotice the picture has a smaller keyboard that snapped on the front bezel\nand a handle on the back. No customers ordered the portable version.\nThe VPU had a Z-80 and an 8086 and could support up to 1MB RAM. Inside the\ncomputer consisted of three circuit boards. Two (over the top of the CRT)\nwas the processor and the RAM. The 1MB RAM took up a whole board.\nThe unit had a 3?\" diskette drive that read Intertec's proprietary formats. The\nmachine could convert CP\/M 2.2 format and MS-DOS 2.1 format data. The\nmachine had a coaxial network board (proprietary protocols) that connected\none of two server machines. A 10\/20MB and a 50 MB.\nThe machine was not popular because of:\n- CP\/M was dying, no one thought 3?\" drives would be accepted (I think this\nwas the first to install 3?\" drives),\n- IBM compatibility (Lotus 123) was a huge issue.\nThe IBM compatible <b>ATS<\/b> was created to answer these objections. The diskette was dropped out and an external 5? drive was added. The machine was sold with IBM PC-DOS 3.1 OS. It ran Lotus 123 and others and was very fast. It\nmaintained the local area network capability. The ATS downfall was\nmonochrome video, an external drive and no hard drive.\nIntertec stopped production of the HeadStart in 1984 and the company reduced\nitself to 12 employees. Service of the HeadStart continued however. A\nNetherlands company picked up the HeadStart name illegally (I remember a\nwrestler was used as the spokesperson for them). The legal issues were\nresolved out of court.\nIntertec was a public company. The name was changed to Wells American\nCorporation around 1985.\nIn 1985 Wells American began production of the <b>A*Star<\/b>. The A*Star was an IBM XT compatible that was exactly like the IBM. It used the 80286 and the speed could be switched: A*Star I 6\/8 MHz, A*Star II 6\/8\/10\/12\/14\/16 MHz. The\nA*Star used PC-DOS 3.x OS and would accept any of the IBM add-ons. Top\nmemory was 1MB. The proprietary network was included with the A*Star I and\nwas promoted as network ready. Wells American added an ISA bus NIC to allow\nIBM compatibles to access the HeadStart file servers. \nThe successful A*Star was sold directly to the enduser and was the first to\nbreak the $1000 barrier. The A*Star was never updated beyond the 80286 by\nWells American. A*Star's were sold with a 30 day money back guarantee,\non-site serviced by RCA\/GE Computer services and guaranteed compatibility\nwith IBM software and hardware add-ons.\nAfter the A*Star, Wells American designed a dual bus 80286\/80386 machine\ncalled the <b>CompuStar I<\/b>. This machine was a floor standing tower and was\ndesigned with the first processor local bus. A separate motherboard held the\nbus interface circuitry. The bus architecture could have been a combination\nof Microchannel or ISA. Only ISA was ordered as microchannel was a flop. The\nCompuStar had a single board processor (proprietary design) that was\ninterchangeable. An 80286 machine could be switched to an 80386 in 10 min.\nThe case was built from extruded aluminum and was a hefty design. \"The Robb\nReport\" picked the CompuStar I as the \"Ultimate\" computer and it received\nthe highest rating given to any hardware product by \"Infoworld\" magazine for\nthe year it was reviewed. 386 processor speeds reached 16\/20\/25MHz.\nThe <b>CompuStar II<\/b> in contrast was a very small machine. It had\ninterchangeable processor boards but only the ISA bus. It could mount 3 half\nheight 5? drives and a 3? fixed drive. Each of the CompuStar machines could\nhold up to 16MB RAM. 80386 Processor speeds were 16\/20\/25\/33 MHz.\nWith the recession of 1988\/9 the expensive CompuStar sales slowed and Wells\nAmerican could not keep up financially, declaring bankruptcy.\nThe A*Star and CompuStar trademarks were sold to CornerStone Technologies,\nInc., in SC. The A*Star is still manufactured by CornerStone.\nI was the production manager when the A*Star was first produced and then\nbecame the Product Manager for the A*Star and CompuStar lines. I am the\nPresident of CornerStone Technologies, Inc. so I have been building the\nA*Star since 1985.",

Ingraham<\/b> (who worked for Osborne) reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The Osborne Vixen was in development at the time the company filed bankruptcy.  I believe it was never offered for sale.  It was developed by a consultant, Fred Coury, as I recall.  It was significantly smaller and lighter than the Osborne 1.  One of the unique aspects of the electronic design was that all of the diskette drive electronics was integrated onto the main printed circuit board of the computer, thus saving cost and space.  The disk electronics for the Vixen was designed by Patrick L. McGuire.  (In typical computers of that time, diskette drives came from their manufacturers with a large electronics board on each drive.)\nThe Vixen was a great follow-on product to the Osborne 1. Unfortunately, the IBM PC was released about that time, and customers stopped buying anything but the PC and, later, the Compaq portable.  The CP\/M computer market disappeared almost overnight.<\/font>\n<b>Barry Carlton<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Your information that the Osborne Vixen was never offered for sale is incorrect.  I owned one from about 1985 to 1988, buying it new from Worswick Industries (Dwight Worswick) in San Diego.  Osborne went into bankruptcy in 1983, as I recall, but reorganized and went back into operation briefly in about 1984 or 1985.  That's when I bought the Vixen (to replace my Osborne 1).  I had the Vixen up until I got my first Mac, in 1988.  Toward the end, I got a modem, joined CompuServe, and also hooked the machine to a 10 Mb hard drive that was horribly noisy, and as long as the Vixen was deep.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Micral-N, introduced in 1973 and powered by Intel's 8008 chip, was the first commercial non-kit computer based on a microprocessor. It was conceived in France by Fran?ois Gernelle and commercialised by a company called <b>R2E<\/b> in 1973. The term <i>\"microcomputer\"<\/i> first appeared in print in reference to the Micral-N.\nThe Micral-N was initially developed for the <b>I.N.R.A<\/b>. (French National Institute for Agronomic Research) which didn't had sufficient budget to buy the lowest \"mini\" at the time (Digital Equipment PDP-8).\nThe development began in July 1972, in a hut in Chatenay-Malabry (Paris suburbs), with <b>F. Gernelle<\/b> and 3 of his collaborators: Mr. <b>Benchetrit<\/b> (soft ingineer), <b>Alain Lacombe<\/b> (electrical technician) and <b>Jean-Claude Beckmann<\/b> (in charge of the mechanical). The first prototype was delivered January, 15th 1973!\nMr. <b>Tuong-Tong-Ti<\/b> arrived later to manage the company, but never influenced anything in the design (not enough knowledge).\nThe 8008 that powered the Micral was essentially an 8-bit 4004. It was originally intended to be a custom chip for Computer Terminals Corp. of Texas (later known as Datapoint). CTC rejected the 8008 because it was too slow and required too many supporting chips, but when Intel offered it to the open market, it was quite successful. \nThe Micral-N was working at 500 KHz, running approximately 50,000 instructions per second. It was set on a bus,  did have a MOS memory, parallel and serial I\/O cards, a real-time system. In one word, it had all the characteristics of nowadays computers. First systems were manufactured and sold at the amazing price (at the time) of 8,500 French Francs (about $1300)\nSupposedly it was the first personal computer programmed by <b>Philippe Kahn<\/b>, founder of Borland.\nR2E, which got under way the Micral-N, developed a whole series of computers based on the most powerful processors of the time: 8080, Z80, 8088, constantly adding improvements like monitor-keyboard in 1974, hard disk in 1975, etc. Every machine was managed by the <b>SYSMIC<\/b> monitor, which became <b>PROLOGUE<\/b> in 1978, a multitask system created in France too.\nThe last of this system was the Micral 20. After that, Bull, who had became the owner of R2E, joined MSDOS standard...\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nPicture and text parts, courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/perso.club-internet.fr\/febcm\/febhista.htm\">Federation des Equipes Bull<\/a> (Federation of Bull teams)\n\t\n<\/font>",

It featured a 8 bit processor, 16 KB of RAM, a built-in 5\" CRT display, tape drive, thermal printer and four I\/O ports.\nThe HP custom processor had 64 8-bit registers but no accumulators. Even slow, it offered outstanding performances in math calculations.\nThe display offered a full screen editor and and a ROLL key allowing to scroll the screen window up and down through a 48 line (three full screens) buffer .\nThe quiet and quite fast printer could print a hard copy of the screen in text or graphic mode as well as direct programs outputs.\nThe built-in tape cartridge system used a common DC100 data cartridge that could hold 195 KB of program files, binary files or data files. Up to 42 file names could be stored in the directory of the tape. A searching function made a file to be found in less than 1 mn. When the system was switched on, the tape drive automatically searched a program called 'Autost' and ran it if found. \nHP also provided a large range of interface modules to be plugged in the expansion slots. The system could then manage several peripherals through GPIB or Serial ports: FDD unit, printers, plotters, etc. A 'ROM Drawer' module allowed up to six ROM chips to be inserted. They expanded the capabilities of the internal BASIC interpreter, provided additional languages (Assembler, Pascal), and I\/O routines for external devices.\nA quite special \"feature\" of the HP-85 was that the screen blanked whenever the printer was printing or the cartridge was accessed!\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=353\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

He says: \"It's a huge computer, built in a metallic desk, with a printer, two 8\" floppy drives, 12\" green-screen monitor (I am not sure, but I do believe it is 12\"), and a keyboard, everything you needed built in. It even had a chair to compliment it! Obviously, it is some kind of office computer\".\nIt has indeed a 12\" screen (white characters 25 x 80) en two 8\" floppy drives 1,2 MB. A harddisk was optional. The programming language was Phocal. (Philips Office Computer Assembly Language).\nThe printer was a 9 pins dot matrix, 100 cps. The P330 was the last product of the Philips Office computers series. Then Philips came with the mircro computers and later the IBM compatibele PC's.\nIn 1992 the Philips computer line was ended.\n_______\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors : Pablo Alvarez Doval, Roy Van Der Lee<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=354\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "This information comes from <b>Bruce Newman<\/b>: \nThe Orb computer was designed and made by ABS Computers Ltd (Allied Business Systems) in the early 1980's. ABS was situated in Portslade (near Brighton) Sussex England. It was a multi-user system running the multi-user version of CPM.\nThe main processor unit was housed in the rectangular box along with the monitor logic card and two 800K 51\/4 floppy drives. Sitting on top in the ball part was the monitor which was a rehoused mono Tatung RS232 terminal. There were Orb satellite units which again were rehoused Tatung RS232 terminals which had a flat base containing the Tatung logic card and a ball on top containing the screen, raster card and its PSU. All the housings were made of metal so you could have it sprayed any colour of your choice (The London Fire Brigade had bright red).\nThe idea was to have the main CPU unit with up to seven RS232 serial satellite terminals scattered around the office with a parallel printer. Serial printers could be used in place of two of the serial terminals.\nThe keyboards were made by Rafi in Italy and they were very flat with keycaps which flew off if you typed too fast!\nI believe up to 1 MB of memory could be fitted along with a SASI (early SCSI) board to run initially either a 10 MB or 20 MB external Rodime drive, fitted with a SASI-ST506 converter board or later versions could run an 85 MB Fujitsu Drive or an Arapaho cartridge drive. A Kennedy 1\/4 Cartridge tape drive could also run externally off the SASI bus.  An external 8\" floppy drive was also available.\nI think that ABS held the rights to the name \"Multi-Buss\" which Intel wanted to use so they did a deal which meant that ABS got the first batches of 8086 CPUs and Intel got the name. Unfortunately these early CPUs had a number of bugs in them, the 80186 was then used.  When all the bugs were sorted out they ran ok and it was one of the first, if not the first, multi-user user microprocessor systems. In true British tradition it was very badly marketed and not many were sold and they usually ended up being used as single user systems \"PC's\" running WordStar. Sales were better when the ball monitor was removed from the top and it was just a rectangular box which we called a \"Flat top\". Another version was in a tower case which was called a \"Torb\".\nThe development costs were high and a large number of components were bought in for the expected sales which never materialised. As the company was owned by the Trafalgar House Group (they also owned the Cunard shipping line and John Brown Engineering) they survived the losses. ABS were taken over by a company called Datapro Computers in 1994 and then they in turn were taken over by the 4Front Group, an American financed company, in 1997.\nThe main designer was a clever chap named Dave Goddard.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=355\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "<i>The following information come from the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.faqs.org\/faqs\/dec-faq\/pdp8-models\/preamble.html\">PDP-8 FAQ<\/a> :<\/i>\nThe VT78 system, also called DECstation or DECstation 78, is based on the Intersil\/Harris 6100 microprocessor and is packaged in a VT52 case.  The 6100 processor was able to run at 4 MHz, but in the VT78, it was only clocked at 2.2 MHz because of the speed of the DRAM used and the deliberate use of graded out chips.\nUsing TTL MSI and LSI components, DEC could pack a system into the vacant space in a standard terminal case, allowing PDP-8 systems to compete with personal computers in the small business and office automation market.  This was a natural follow-on to the desk-mounted workstation configurations in which the PDP-8\/A was already being sold.\nApart from some minor details, it is fully PDP-8\/E compatable, even at the level of I\/O instructions for the standard periperals; this was the last PDP-8 to offer this level of compatability.\nIt was not possible to continue from a halt without restarting the machine. In addition, none of the peripherals available on this machine needed DMA (data break) transfers.\nThe VT78 was sold with 16k words of DRAM with the keyboard and display of the VT52 terminal. An RX01 dual 8\" diskette drive was included, packaged in a teacart pedestal under the terminal.  The console (device 03\/04) and the serial ports (devices 30\/31 and 32\/33) are compatible with the M8650 KL8E, with the latter extended to allow software controlled baud rate selection.  There are two parallel ports; device 66 (compatible with the M8365 printer controller) and device 47, compatible with the nonstandard port on the M8316 DKC8AA. There is also a 100Hz clock compatible with the clock on the M8316 DKC8AA.\nThe standard ROM boots the system from the RX01 after setting the baud rates to match that selected by the switches on the bottom of the VT52 case.\nThis was a closed system, with few options.  The base configuration was able to support two RX01 drives (later RX02), for a total of 4 transports.  Various boot ROM's were available,\n including a paper-tape RIM loader ROM for loading diagnostics from tape.  Another ROM boots the system from a PDP-11 server in the client\/server configuration used by WPS-11.\n<i>All the above information come from the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.faqs.org\/faqs\/dec-faq\/pdp8-models\/preamble.html\">PDP-8 FAQ<\/a>...<\/i>\nThe V778 came with a FORTRAN, a BASIC compilers, the PAL-8 assembler and various other utilities.\nThe standard DECstation configuration, which includes the VT78 (video terminal, mainboard, memory, real time clock and floppy drive interface) and a dual floppy disk was priced at $7995.",

It's a good example of what was developped in Japan and we never heard of in the rest of the world.\nThe system has great audio and video features, hence the AV for \"Audio and Video\". It can display 640 x 200 pixels in two colors, or 320 x 200 in 4096 colors ! There is even a multipage mode where you can define two 460 x 200 screens with 8 colors each, or six 640 x 200 monochrome screens !\nThere are a lot of graphical symbols already stored in memory (each symbol \/ letter is composed by 8 x 8 pixels) : 69 alphanumeric symbols, 63 kakatana signs, 63 hiragana signs and 62 graphic symbols. Moreover, the system is capable of displaying 3418 chinese and asiatic characters with a 16 x 16 character matrix (text resolution is thus of 40 x 12).\nLast but not least, the FM 77 AV offers superimposition features...\nOn the sound side, it offers three FM voices and three more PSG voices. Other cool features include infra-red keyboard and built-in real time clock.\nThere were two models : the <b>AV-1<\/b> which has one 3.5\" disk-drive (double density) built-in and the <b>AV-2<\/b> which is equiped with two of these drives.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/www3.wind.ne.jp\/toragiku\/\" target=\"_blank\">Junya Kubota's museum<\/a>.<\/font>",

        "description": "Introduced may 1981, the FM 8 was one of the first Fujitsu micro computers (after the LKIT-8 hobby computer in 1977). In any case it was the first member of the FM series, FM standing for \"Fujitsu Micro\". At that time its features were really impressive: bi-processor (even an additionnal Z80 cpu could be installed), 64 KB RAM, bubble memory, built-in chinese characters ROM, 640x200 high resolution with 8 colors and no proximity conflict!\nThe FM-8 was developed by employing innovative design and state-of-the-art semiconductor technology, and was designed for use in a variety of fields, ranging from high-level hobby use, to business applications and process control.\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipsj.or.jp\/katsudou\/museum\/computer\/4050_e.html\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese Computer Museum<\/a> specifies:\n<i>\"The FM-8 had the following features:\n- Equipped with two Motorola 6809 8-bit CPUs (main and sub)\n- The world's first use of 64 kilobit DRAM (like that in large main frame computer) in a microcomputer (64 kilobyte main memory)\n- Japanese language display using Chinese character (kanji) ROM (JIS level 1 2,965 characters, optional)\n- High-resolution color graphics (640x200 dot, 8 colors selectable at each dot)\n- The provided operating systems (OS) included F-BASIC, as well as UCSD-PASCAL, FLEX and CP\/M (required Z80 card option)\n- First use in a personal computer of bubble memory as external memory (At the time of announcement, the machine had a bubble cassette with a 32 kilobyte capacity. A 128 kilobyte cassette was added later. Bubble memory did not catch on, however, and was eliminated from the standard features in the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=325\">FM-7<\/a>.)\"<\/i>\nWhen booted, a menu offers different choices:\n1 - F-BASIC (ROM\/DISK mode)\n2 - DOS (mini- floppy disk)\n3 - Bubble memory\n4 - DOS (standard floppy disk)\nThere are a lot of character sets available (8x8 matrix): 69 alphanumeric char., 63 katakana signs and 62 graphic symbols. And for characters with a 16x16 pixels matrix: 2965 chinese characters (JIS standard level 1) and 453 non-chinese characters (JIS non-chinese characters).\nOptional mini floppy disks could be connected (320 KB each), as well as an expansion unit which allowed many things (voice input\/ouput, hard disk connection, RS232c interface, analog interface for measurement,etc.)\nIn November 1982, Fujitsu announced a upper model of the FM-8 called the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=379\">FM-11<\/a>, and a mass-market model called the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=325\">FM-7<\/a>.\n_____________\nNomura, Hisayuki reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nFujitsu FM 8 \/ 7 have a very unique feature. They have 2 CPUs. 1 for Main CPU (it's usual) and 1 for Graphics. Graphic CPU has their own boot ROM and main program. The Graphic CPU recieves request from Main CPU and draw pictures with their software. The two CPUs share small part of memory area and uses this shared area exclusively.<\/font>\nGern adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">In addition to Mr. Nomura's report. During game programmers there was famous \"Hidden\" feature.\nThe performance of FM-8 was not so excellent as many people expected. Dual CPU concept was bottleneck. When main CPU stores command code to shared memory, sub CPU get halt. Sub CPU restarts and start drawing. Problem was size of shared memory; 128 bytes are too small to store massive graphic requests. That is, FM series are not appropriate for hobby use.\nHowever, One of BIOS programmer, Mr.Yamauchi in Fujitsu Ltd. left several hidden commands in sub-system BIOS, which is called YAMAUCHI command. These command permitted us to transfer large binary programs to reserved memory space and JMP! After unveiled this hacking technique, FM series are known to their performance in games.<\/font>",

It was a\nPIN\/Code compatible CMOS\/3MHz version of the MC68B09E from Motorola. For licensing reasons Hitachi kept as a \"secret\" that it has a special\nnative mode with additional instructions\/registers\/capabilities and more\nspeed. I don't think these features were used in the stock OS-9 Level II\ninstalled.\nWith our <a href=\"computer.asp?c=109\">CoCo3s<\/a> and the CPU changed to an HD63C09EP we use a\nspecial OS-9 version called NitrOS9 to take advantage of this native\nmode.\n<b>Gern<\/b>, from Japan, reports:\nI've owned FM-11AD2, used for 3 years. Here I wanna introduce unique aspect of this wonderful machine.\nOne of the interesting feature of FM-11 series is CPU cards. All FM-11 without BS model equipped a couple of CPU slots and one is filled with 6809. Z80 and 8088 CPU card was available from FUJITSU. 68000 card was available from third party. CP\/M-80\/86 was available for each CPU cards. (But everytime system boots from 6809 ;-)\nFM-11BS might be only model come with 8088.\nAfter ST\/AD\/EX line-up, AD2 and BS replaced, then AD2+ followed. OS-9 was packaged with AD2\/AD2+. AD2+ is supposed to be the longest one which FUJITSU manufactured because amazing multitask was appropriate for many  industrial devices. When I was noticed from final lots of FM-11AD2+ from FUJITSU, over 2 following generation FM series were extinct.\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The model number was FM-16s, and it was sold in the USA from about 1983 to around 1985.\nIt had dual processors on daughter boards, one with a Zilog Z-80a and the other with an i8086 on a true 16-bit bus. Hard drives were external, connecting through a SCSI host adapter. The machine could have up to 2MB of RAM on a proprietary expansion card, and ran at 8MHz. It had a 640x480 16 color display and 104 keys keyboard.\nCP\/M-86, WordStar, SuperCalc and the C\/PM-86 operating system were bundled with the basic purchase; but the FM-16 could also run CP\/M 2.2, a proprietary version of MS-DOS 1.0, Concurrent CP\/M-86 and PICK. If all were installed in partitions on the hard drive, you had a choice of OS at boot time.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n<b>Ron Edelstein<\/b> adds:\nActually, the FM-16s had a video of 640x400 (not 480). It was a double-scanned format using 16 colours. Much better and sharper than the later IBM EGA standard, even though IBM used 480 lines. Using a proprietary version of MS-DOS, it could run any software not requiring graphics (i.e. text mode). The difference in video prevented it from displaying IBM graphics displays unless they were specifically recompiled for the FM-16s, as were SuperCalc and WordStar.\n<\/font>",

One of the first to do so was Bill Millard who founded IMS Associates.\nThe computer they designed, the IMSAI 8080, was very similar to the Altair 8800 and was designed to run the same software. However, it was a much better design, with a higher specification power supply, an anodized aluminum chassis, 22 slots on the S-100 bus, and a great front panel design. \nThe IMSAI 8080 aimed to take advantage of the Altair's popularity, the inability of MITS to meet a growing demand for the product, and the need to improve on some of the internal components. Like the Altair, the IMSAI came either in kit form, or preassembled at the factory.\nAt the production starting, the IMSAI was shipped deliberately missing many parts in the kit version, because the company hadn't received them yet. But since IMSAI promised delivery by a certain date, they shipped them anyway!\nLike the Altair system, there were no keyboard but a front panel and switches used to program the system. The LED's blinked, depending of the values found on the address and data buses. One could manually stop the CPU, single step the CPU, and read and write to memory locations.\nIn the end, the IMSAI outlasted the Altair by several years. Owners were delighted to see it featured in the 1984 movie \"War Games\", with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. Through the years, it has remained a much-beloved design amongst vintage computer collectors, and newly-manufactured parts and documentation are still available!

        "description": "As for the PC-88xx series, a lot of versions were released. In 1988, PC-98xx were already sold for hobby users. 8-bit machines were about to become history. The PC-8801FE was positioned as a low-cost entry machine but it did not succeed in the market.\nThis machine did not have expansion slot, nor N88-BASIC disks (only disk-utilities were included), in order to reduce cost. But it had video-output and superimpose feature to enjoy games on a television. This was the sole new feature.\nHowever, Televisions were already hijacked by Nintendo and RGB monitors were already available for PC-9801. There was no place left for the PC-8801FE.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Nomura Hisayuki for the info<\/font>",

It was firstly aimed at technicians, but it met a great success with first computer hobbyists. It was often sold as a kit.\nThe systems is directly programmed in machine-code through the hexadecimal keyboard. There are 9 \"function\" keys on this keyboard : RET, RUN, STORE DATA, LOAD DATA, RESET, ADRS SET, READ INCR, READ DECR, WRITE INCR.\nInformation is displayed on the built-in 7-segments LED display (1 line, 8 characters).\nThe <b>TK-80E<\/b> is low-cost TK-80. The CPU and some chips are slightly different (uPD8080AD -&gt; uPD8080AFC, uPD8228D -&gt; uPD8228C, uPD454D -&gt; uPD464C, uPD5101E -&gt; uPD2101AL-4), thus reducing the production cost (ceramic -&gt; plastic). Of course the TK-80E was less expensive.\nThe <b>TK-80 BS<\/b> was a \"Basic Station\" model. It was composed of a TK-80 board with a BASIC ROM built-in, 7k RAM and an alphanumeric keyboard.

        "description": "The Tandy TRS 80 model 1 was the first member of one of the most famous computer family. It was one of the first home computer and was launched at the same time as famous computers like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=191\">Commodore PET<\/a>. Beside, Tandy competitors nicknamed was \"Trash-80\".\nThe TRS-80 was developed was developed within the Radio Shack engeneering group, based upon several processor chips, SC\/MP, PACE, 8008, 8080 and finally the Z80.\nIt used a black &amp; white TV set, made by RCA, without tuner as monitor. The earlier models use a poor basic called Basic Level 1 (the Basic and the OS fit in the 4 KB ROM!). It was replaced later with the Basic Level 2 which needed a 12 KB ROM.\nTo offset its poor characteristics, Tandy developed a device called Expansion Interface which brings a lot of new features : additional 16 or 32kb RAM, two tape unit connectors, a printer port, a floppy disk controller, a serial port and a real time clock.\nTandy did as well 5, 10 and 15 MB hard drives. The case for them is about the size of a small PC tower. It's possible to fit 2 drives into each case. They were compatible with all TRS-80 versions.\nWhen it was connected to a floppy disk unit, the TRS-80 uses the TRS DOS operating system, it was pretty bugged and most of the TRS-80 users prefered NEW DOS, it was an operating system done by a third-party company called Apparat. This OS was the real TRS-80 operating system.\nLS-DOS was also an excellent DOS, superior to NEW DOS for most users. Interestingly, Microsoft's MS-DOS became more and more like LS-DOS each time it was updated, although never as good. LS-DOS was finally adopted by Tandy as the official DOS for the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=244\">Model 4<\/a>.\nDocumentation for all the TRS machines was superb. Even Microsoft provided documentation for its BASIC interpreter listing all the machine calls. You could use these calls when programming with either machine code or BASIC.\nThe Model I was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=243\">TRS 80 model II<\/a> (a business computer) and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=18\">model III<\/a> which had almost the same characteristics as the model I.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors :<\/b> Donald French, Paul D Moore<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=409\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Another strange MZ family member. At the moment, we have no information about it. It seems to be a \"super <a href=\"computer.asp?c=173\">MZ 80B<\/a>\" (that?s what the badge says, anyway), but we are not sure it was compatible with it.\nTo our knowledge, the MZ-2000 was never regularly exported outside Japan.\nA \"16 Bit Bord Kit\" was sold in April 1983 to expand the 8-bit computer to a 16-bit system. Price: $327.\n<b>Junichi Katagiri<\/b> from Japan adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nInteresting about this model was that when it powered up, the user would\nhave to wait some time for BASIC to load from a cassette tape into RAM. (I\ndon't recall the version number) Loading was an automated process, which\ntook 1 to 2 minutes. If there wasn't correct install tape in the cassette\ndeck when it is powered on, the cassette player would open up asking for\nproper install tape.\nThis was one of MZ-2000's unique features. (Personally\nI thought this action was robotic and cool, extremely advanced in technology\nat the time in my mind. Just to see the computer \"ask\" me to put the tape\ninto the player, I used to keep the tape out on purpose every time I\nswitched it on. My friends seemed to be impressed at the sight) And the\npower switch was in the back of the unit, which I think was typical of\npersonal computers then.\nOf course, computers did not have internal hard disc drives back then, so\nwhenever power is turned off the computer would lose all its data in memory.\nAnything which wasn't recorded into tape is gone at that point.\nI used to spend alot of time playing with music command in BASIC. MZ-2000\nwas capable of playing back maximum of three sound parts simultaneously.\n(nothing more than plain old \"beep\" sound with pitch variations.) There\nwere, I think,  three octaves of chromatic notes, which could be accessed by\ncodes like \"C1D1E2+C2...\" Compared to today's sound editors the method was\nvery clumsy for musicians to make use. I remember it challenged my patience\nquite a bit. :)<\/font>\n(Editor's note: This comment also apply to the Sharp <a href=\"computer.asp?c=173\">MZ-80B<\/a>)",

        "description": "The Genie 1 was compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=409\">Tandy TRS-80 Model I<\/a>.\nA 5.25\" floppy disk drive (100 KB, 40 tracks). However, 80 track double-sided drives could be used if the operating system supported it. Due to some poor design, only 3 drives could be used and the last drive had to be single-sided. In fact the limitations of the floppy disks depended on the controller. Some controllers were able to drive up to 4 double sided disks. There also was a 'doubler' device available which doubled the capacity of the disks by replacing the 1791(?) controller chip.\nA graphic expansion was available as well and provided a maximum graphic resolution of 384 x 192, it was necessary to modify the internals of the machine to fit it.\nAn expansion interface (similar to the TRS-80?s) could be connected to the expansion bus and provided RAM upgrade (up to 32K), floppy disk, printer interface, and an expansion slot for an optional RS232 interface. An alternative Operating system available from the USA and called LS-DOS could run on this version.\nThe Genie had an 'expansion' connector on the back side carrying all necessary signals. One of them ('Phantom') could be used to remove Keyboard, ROM and video-RAM from the memory map and provide the whole 64K memory to the CPU. This enabled the machine to run CP\/M, which was a nice feature. The only drawback: the video resolution was only 64 characters wide - not 80 as required by CP\/M.\nFor better readability on standard TV-sets (a VHF modulator was build-in) the horizontal resolution could be switched to 32 chars with a switch on the back side. Another Key on the keyboard 'Page' then could be used to display the left or right half of the screen. A nice feature at a time where computer monitors were expensive,\nbut a pain when writing texts! Early versions had 7 bit video-RAM which prevented display of lower case letters.\nOne year later (1981), a new model was launched : the Video Genie II. Basically, it is Video Genie 1 with a numeric keypad instead of the built-in tape-recorder (see ''more pictures'' section)...\nDick Smith Electronics in Australia brought out a re-badged version of the Video Genie called the System 80. These were identical except of course they carried the Dick Smith Logo. They also sold a 'business' version with the keyboard, two floppy disk drives and expansion box with a clunky little printer.\nThese machines were expandable with after-market parts - you could purchase Exabyte \"stringy floppy\" drives (an eternal loop tape that held 4 programs, pretty much regardless of size, and ran somewhere between tape and disk speed).  You could also purchase memory chips, which you added by soldering onto the top of the existing chips.  There were a few magazines dedicated to the System 80\/TRS-80 in Australia\/New Zealand, which carried basic program listings.\nThey also didn't have a volume control on the tape drive - it wasn't uncommon to see second hand units that had had that added. The System 80 came with a Dick-Smith tape that, amongst other things, had a program that played \"flight of the bumble bee\" - badly ;)\nBy entering SYSTEM 12288 into the Video Genie, it would give you lower case letters, a flashing cursor and auto repeat on keys.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b> : Lothar Merl, Adrian Williams, Kevin Littlejohn, Daniel Smith<\/font>\n<b>Kevin Littlejohn<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">These machines were expandable with after-market parts - you could purchase Exabyte \"stringy floppy\" drives (an eternal loop tape that held 4 programs, pretty much regardless of size, and ran somewhere between tape and disk speed).

It looks like the computer was produced in Hong-Kong and then proposed to several companies in the rest of the world to market the computer under their own brand.\nHowever no such computers have been found so far, maybe proving that the original company failed to produce the computer, or that it canceled the project at last minute, or that so few were sold that it's difficult to find a specimen today...\nBut if you look at the pictures section, you'll notice the that the computer evolved in different plastic cases. The \"Charlemagne\" picture, shows a case and keyboard identical to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=331\">CCE MC1000 computer<\/a>.

The MSX computers produced by General are called 'Paxon', PCT meaning 'Paxon Computer TV'.\nThis machine has only one cartridge slot integrated in the left side of the monitor. Joysticks can be connected directly to the display\/main unit. The PCK-50 keyboard is thus optional as the computer can be used as a gaming console with built-in display.\nThe MSX is internally connected to the monitor via a \"high quality\" RGB interface. This was appreciated by the Japanese users who wanted to make quality screendumps of their favorite games.\nThe official price is ?128,000 for the main unit, ?3,500 for a PCJ-50 joystick and ?18,500 for the keyboard.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to MSX.org for most of the info.<\/font>",

        "description": "The HP-110 was the first laptop computer to offer the power and the possibilities of a desktop. As it was possible to connect a printer and a disk-drive to it, it was a very serious machine in its category, with Lotus 1-2-3 integrated.\nThis was the good occasion for Hewlet-Packard to introduce a laptop computer when IBM and Apple were not yet on this part of the market. The HP-110 is somehow compatible with its big brother, the HP-150, and can communicate with HP \"calculators\" like the HP-41c.\nIts design looks like the Dulmont Magnum or the Gavilan produced at the same time. The screen can be tilted to accomodate the right angle of vision for the user.\nThe HP-110 is equiped with a 8086 16-bit CPU which is much more powerful than the 8088 for example used in the HP-150.\nOne year later, HP presented the <b>Portable Plus<\/b> with bigger screen, more memory upgrade and the possibility to change the internal ROM software.\n______\n<b>Rich Wilson<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The HP-110 and Portable Plus were actually multi-processor computers! I see something on the schematic called a PPU, and its part number seems to be 146?0562. But it's blurry; the ? might be 3 or 8, and the 0 might be an 8. In sleep mode, the 8086 is powered off, and the PPU is given the job of keeping the time, controlling the power supply and charger, monitoring the power button, etc.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=445\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It's so close that when people write Laser emulators, they use TRS-80 CoCo ROM documentations (Laser detailed documentations are hard to find, especially about the ROM itslef).\nThe Basic was a Microsoft Basic just slightly modified to avoid lawsuits, some statements being stored in the ROM but not available on the machine!\nLike the most of the Vtech products, the Laser 100\/110 was \"cheaply\" conceived: chicklet keyboard, plastic case, light-weight... It was produced to compete against the first wave of micro-computers like the famous Sinclair <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">ZX-81<\/a>.\nThe difference between the Laser 100 and the Laser 110 must be the RAM size (like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=155\">Laser 200 and 210<\/a>), though very little information on the Laser 100 is available.\nThe biggest difference with its big brother the Laser <a href=\"computer.asp?c=155\">200<\/a> was that it only had a black &amp; white display. \nAn obscure VZ-100 version was also released but this wasn't the same machine as the VZ series sold in Australia and New-Zealand by Dick Smith Electronics.",

        "description": "Marquette Electronics specialised in medical systems is now part of GE Medical.\nThis system was called the Marquette 8000 Holter System.  It's purpose was to analyze 24 hr tape recordings of a patients heart activity to determine any abnormalities. Clinically historicaly as it was the worlds first computer restrospective Holter scanner. Prior to that a clinician would have to sit in front of a screen and watch 24 hrs of ECG data buzz on a screen and halt on any aberrant beats to be recorded. This system. would play in and digitize the analog recorded ECG from the cassette reader (could also purchase a TEAC reel-reel as an option) recorded at 1 3\/4 ips, \"digest\" the ECG and parse out ventricular vs normal vs SVE aberrant morphologies. This was the predecessor to the Laser SXP, another DEC 11\/23 based Holter system.\nThe way the system functioned: a cardiac patient would wear a Holter cassette recorder on his\/her body for 24\/48 hours and the tape would record all the patients heart beats. After 24\/48 hours the tape was removed from the recording device and played back into the system. The Holter system analyzed the patient''s beat to beat data (for heart abnormalities) and constructed reports for a technician or doctor to review.\nThe main computer used a DEC 11\/23 Processor running RSX-11, 1MB memory board, serial board (J-Board), SCSI HD Controller Card, an Array Processor Board, and a graphics controller board.  The CRT was monochrome and not touchscreen.  The printer was a 9 pin dot matrix type.  The main boot hard drive was 80 MB and the storage drive was a 160 MB.\nMarquette dominated the cardiology (Stress,EKG &amp; Holter) business in the US during the 1980s and this unit probably sold new for around $35-55,000.00. US customers has been reported as of July 2003 still using this unit.",

        "description": "Little is known about this Slovak clone of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX Spectrum<\/a>.\nOne of its particularity is that it has a separated reset button and two joystick ports (1 Kempston + 1 Sinclair). But both joystick ports have non-standard connectors.\nThe ULA (video chip) is different from the one used in the original Spectrum. It's a russian circuitry, and it results in the screen being square instead of rectangle. Because of these russian ICs, the Diaktik M was actually much more compatible with Russian Spectrum clones (like the Pentagons) than with original ZX Spectrum.\nThe Didaktik M seems to be sold as a 64 KB RAM computer but only 48 KB is available. \nTwo models of the Didaktik M were produced (90 &amp; 91). The <a href=\"computer.asp?c=953\">Didaktik Kompakt<\/a> is in fact the same computer with a built-in floppy drive on the right side of the unit.\nA 3 channel sound interface with ACB stereo called \"Melodik\" was also available, as well as a 3.5\" external floppy drive called D80.\nDidaktik M and Kompakt are still sold online <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kompaktservis.cz\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>!\n<b>Richard<\/b> reports to us:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere was external 5.25\" floppy drive produced called Didaktik D40. I think it was able to take memory snapshots with a snapshot key located on the connector to the floppy. Later there was Didaktik M Kompakt produced which had 3.5\" floppy integrated on the right side of the unit. I used this computer to play games, was fun.<\/font>\n<b>Predseda<\/b> (Czech Rep.) adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nIt has one of the most uncomfortable keyboards ever.

So the Gama computers used a bank switching technique, with two 32k additional RAMs. There was even a LED on the case, which indicated if the RAM have been switched or not!\nThe Gama computers had a built-in paralel i8255 interface. They used the original Ferranti ULA and had russian made memory chips.\nThe Gama computers were not fully compatible with the original <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Sinclair Spectrum<\/a> due to some system variables differences.\nIn fact several models were made.\n- The first one was black and, as it was made in 1987, it is often called Gama'87. It had a bank switching bug : if you switched the banks and the RAMTOP variable was above 32768, then the computer simply crashed...\n- In 1988, the Gama'88 was launched (grey case). It's main difference is that the bank switching bug was repaired.\n- One year later, the Gama'89 (guess why) was released because the '88 model was still quite buggy. Some bugs in ROM were corrected and hardware was a little bit changed, so the compatibility was improved. It has only latin character set and a print routine was implemented in ROM. The Gama'99 was the last and the best model of the Gama serie, it was manufactured up to 1992.",

The keyboard folded up over the CRT (if you look at the picture just rotate the keyboard in place so that the spacebar is at the top of the machine).

You could also change the occilator crystal for overclocking but then you had to retune the video circuitry to get the image back to full screen. Original speed was approx 4.78Mhz? same as a standard PC of the day but by changing the crystal you could get up to (on mine at least) a blazing ~5Mhz (whoopie! ;-). I _think_ there was a IC socket for an 8087 on the motherboard (if memory serves me correctly). I ran DR-dos and Desqview (no mouse at the time but it had a serial port, so later you could add one -when they became available-). This was one heavy machine as I recall running through JFK trying to catch a flight while hauling this puppy.<\/font>",

The only difference between \nthese two was that the former had 4 KB RAM and the latter 10 KB. Internally, \nthey were operated by the SC61860 CPU (8 bits), which was clocked 33% faster \nthan in the PC-1251.\nThe CPU was mounted on the main PCB, together with the two display driver chips SC43536. Memory was incorporated on a second small PCB. The PC-1260 had the SC613256 ROM plus two HM6116 8K x 8 RAM ICs. The PC-1261 had the \nsame ROM, but five \"naked\" RAM chips, i.e. chips without DIL case, mounted \ndirectly onto the PCB.\nTwo years later, the PC-1261 was re-released as the PC-1262. It was identical in functional terms, but had a different case color scheme. Internally, it was \nbased on the same main PCB, but the memory PCB was now equipped with a SC623257 ROM, a HM6264 8K x 8 RAM, and a LH5116 2K x 8 RAM.\nThe picture represents a PC-1261 mounted on a CE-125 micro cassette recorder and thermal printer unit.\nInformation provided by <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\">Roman von Wartburg<\/a>.",

Indeed DEC realised that the PDP-8 based products were rarely expanded to their full potential. Thus, they conceived the DECmate III wich offers less expansion possibilities but which was also cheaper.\nAs the last incarnation of the PDP-8 technology, the DECmate III use a single chip containing all the PDP-8 hardware !\nOnly one pair of 5''1\/4 disk-drives (RX50) is supported and it is not possible to connect a Hard-Drive. But unlike the DECmate II, a color monitor can replace the monochrom screen.\nIt was mainly intended for professionnal word-processing, but could also run other software including OS\/278. The DECmate III was compatible with the DECmate II.\nIn 1985, a DECmate III+ was sold with a hard disk controller built-in and overall completely new hardware components, though still compatible with the DECmate II and III.\nThe DECmate computers were marketed  by Digital Equipment Corporation.",

It's a rugged field computer, conceived to be used outdoor, and resistant to extreme conditions (it was used in the British Army for example).\nIn 1981, responding to a request from Severn Trent Water, DVW designed and manufactured the first rugged handheld computer - the Husky, dramatically featured on the BBC TV programme 'Tomorrow's World'. This caught the attention of the UK Ministry of Defence, who subsequently awarded DVW a contract to supply the MOD with rugged handheld computers as part of the Rapier missile project.\nHusky (it will become the name of the company some years later) has become since a familiar name in the niche market for rugged field hardware.\nThe Husky was the first, or at least one of the first real portable computer. And as it was waterproof against accidental immersion and rugged, it was very expensive (~5600 Euros).\nThe Husky had a small LCD screen (32 x 4) and a flat membrane keyboard, just like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">Sinclair ZX-81<\/a>.\nIt has a basic interpreter, an onboard clock (unsurprisingly lacking in\nmillennium compliency), onboard routines for communicating through what\nlooks like a serial port interface, as well as a menu option for \"cloning husky\".\nThis must be used to clone multiple Husky systems that will all be used for the same purpose,\nrather than re-entering the BASIC code for each unit.\nThe unit stores programmed entered into the basic interpreter in some kind\nof solid state memory which must be powered by the backup battery (since when you take the backup battery out, you lose the basic code).\nIn 1983, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=285\">Husky Hunter<\/a> is launched.

The standard version had a classic 9'' monochrome monitor built-in.\nUnfortunately the advantages of the PC Portable compared to IBM's offer was not obvious. It was not really compatible (IBM disks could be read, and that was basically all) and IBM expansion cards could not be used.\nDespite this lack of real compatibility, some software were adapted to the TI Portable PC like for instance, Lotus 1-2-3 or VisiOn.\nA few programming languages were available: Basic, Pascal, C-Basic, Cobol and RM-Cobol.\nThe graphical possibilities were quite different and significantly better than for the IBM PC, with for example, a maximum resolution is of 720 x 300 pixels. To make a IBM PC graphic program to run on a TI PC you would have to use BIOS or DOS calls.\nThe TI PPC had only 64k RAM that could be expanded up to 768k using quite expensive memory cards.\nLike its desktop brother, the PC Portable could eventually be equiped with a voice recognition feature (for almost the price of the computer itself !) that allowed to control the basic functions of the computer and some softwares, as a diary and a phone book. With the optional hard-disk installed, it was possible to store up to 8 hours of speech.\nAnother interesting feature was its Ethernet card indoduced in 1983, designed by a young company called 3COM.",

        "description": "The Sanyo MBC-550 was the first of the legitimate \"clones\" of the IBM Personal Computer. While others (notably the Taiwanese) were duplicating the circuitry and Read-Only Memories (ROMs) of the IBM PC, Sanyo Business Systems designed their own circuitry and wrote their own Basic Input\/Output System (BIOS), part of which was in ROM and part was on disk. The character set was also in ROM. In Japan, this computer was the MBC-55. It came with a kanji character set and the CP\/M-86 operating system. Sanyo had Microsoft write a special version of their disk operating system (MS-DOS) and command interpreter (COMMAND.COM). They had MicroPro write special versions of WordStar, CalcStar, and EasyWriter which they bundled with the MBC-550, making it a very attractive package, not only for their intended market, business; but also for the computer hobbyist.\nThe Sanyo 55x was the first MS-DOS compatible computer that retailed for under US$1000. It was also quite possibly the only (somewhat) IBM-compatible system that was actually slower than an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a> (the PC clocked at 4.77 MHz, while the Sanyo clocked at 3.6, giving it a Norton SI rating of 0.8). \nIt came with 5.25\" floppy drives sized from 160 KB to 800 KB. One thing the machine had that was odd was a floppy controller for 4 floppy drives, you simply chained them and adjusted the DSx jumper on the drives. The drives were labeled ABCD and if a hard drive was added it became E even if you only had 2 floppy drives as the BIOS reserved A-D for floppy drives. The floppy drives in these models were from Teac. Interestingly, the drive lights always stayed on when the door was closed. They did not go out even if the drive was not currently being accessed.\nThey were manufactured &amp; sold from about 1983 to about 1988. The different models are:\n- MBC-550 : 1 x 5.25\" disk-drive (160 KB)\n- MBC-555 : 2 x 5.25\" disk-drive (160 KB)\n- MBC-555-2 : 2 x 5.25\" disk-drive (360 KB)\n- MBC-555-3 : 2 x 5.25\" disk-drive (720 KB)\nThe default graphics were easy to use: three straight 640x400 bitplanes, R, G, and B. There was no text mode, so stock IBM PC apps that bypassed the video BIOS did not work. The main add-on card was a Sanyo CGA color card, that transformed the original Sanyo into about a 90% PC IBM compatible computer. The CGA board was EXPENSIVE and one version added memory to 640 KB as well.\nWhile the mixed text-and-graphics video made it incompatible with many programs intended for the IBM (Lotus 1-2-3 being the benchmark at the time), WordStar worked just fine, as did Microsoft Excel (the original MS-DOS version) and also Borland's Turbo Pascal compiler. If your consideration was more for file interchangeability (it ran MS-DOS 2.1) than for software compatibility, the Sanyo was a solid, workhorse system at a very reasonable price.\nA lot of \"IBM PC\" software at the time accessed the address of the video cards directly - B800:0000 for color and B000:0000 for monochrome, since the Sanyo had no video card at this address the video output was never seen. Sanyo offered the CGA card that was present at this address for direct memory writing.\nThere was a pinout on the motherboard for a ribbon cable that would accept a 5 MB hard disk. The 55x motherbaord also included a socket for an 8087 math coprocessor, which helped with spreadsheet applications.\nSoft Sector magazine and all the BBS systems specific such as First Sanyo Opus and the Sanyo supporting clubs kept these working and many many mods from power supply fixes to memory addons (768 KB was possible) to serial board mods, hard drive addons, etc came out of these.\nThe MS-DOS had to be specific to this machine as well, you couldnt boot the generic versions. There were a few aftermarket DOS's that gave extra abilities to include 800 KB from 720 KB floppy drives. A few people even professed to adding 3.5\" drives. A-OK company wrote a OS for the system as well, called A-OK DOS. \nAmong the quirks to the machine: the power supply was not a regular switching power supply. It was a transformer. Also the keyboard had no ALT key - made it nuts to operate software made for IBM specific machines! The IBM PC\/XT at the time had 10 function keys while the Sanyo had half that amount. To get the higher function keys you would need to do these strange shift combinations.\nWhen you push the power button, you definately had the feeling that Sanyo had borrowed some parts from their stereo division!\nThis systems was also proposed when you got a course through NRI.\n_________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Russ Blakeman, David Botkin, Joe Dellea, Steven Koehler, Victor Frank<\/font>",

The main physical difference is the LCD screen which can be tilted for user's comfort.\nJust like its brothers, the M-10 was used a lot by reporters all around the world. This success was mainly due to its excellent keyboard and large battery autonomy.\nThe M-10 a some built-in software :\n- An Extended Microsoft Basic\n- A wordprocessor\n- A small spreadsheet (adress files)\n- An Agenda\n- And a communication program.\nThe M10 had 4 standard RAM\/ROM sockets, whereas all other Kyocera machines had specific RAM or ROM sockets.\nThe french model doesn't seem to have the modem built-in as it is the case for the \"normal\" M-10.

The advantage is that it's quite fast and you can change the memory cartridges (64k or 128k each) in the computer. Thus you can reach 256k RAM, or you can insert applications stored on ROM modules. But the main drawback of theses memories, is that there are very expensive !\nThe PC-5000 uses MS-DOS but is not really PC compatible, although Sharp tried to sell it by focusing on this point.\nSome good software was available for the PC-5000, including Easy-Writer II (wordprocessor), Easy-Comm (communications)and Easy-Planner (spreadsheet). There were sold together as the EasyPac (some sources say that Easy-Report was included).\nEasyMenu was the menu-interface built-in the PC-5000.",

One slot was often used for the BS Basic programming language and the other could be used for special expansion cartridges (to connect a printer for example). \nThe BS-Basic cartridge was also equipped with connectors to plug a tape-recorder into the RX-78.\nWhile games were the main software developed for this computer an asian brand word processor was also available.",

In the 80's it was sold as an Z80 CPU learning and initiation system, and believe it or not, it is still in production and sold by www.flite.co.uk !! at the time this article is written.\nThe capacities of the system were quite poor. The standard model could be programmed only in machine code through the small hexadecimal keyboard. When sold in it's original package it had the particularity to look like a book when closed.\nThere was an EPROM socket which can be compared to a cartridge slot. A mini-Basic EPROM and some other utilities and languages were available as options.\nThere are in fact two models : <b>MPF-1<\/b> (later called MPF-1A) and <b>MPF-1B<\/b>. The MPF-1(A) is machine code programmed only whereas the MPF-1B offers a really crude version of BASIC (one button = 1 command,  as per the early TRS-80) in addition to the machine code capabilities. \n_______________________\n<b>Chris<\/b> remembers:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nAfter teaching myself 6510 machine code on the C64 (well Commodore Basic was useless) aged 15, I 'formally' learnt machine code programming at college (aged 16) on one of these things when I was aged 16~18 during my Ordinary National Diploma in Electronics Engineering.\nI can remember the abject frustration of typing in Machine Code in Hex, I suppose it could of been worse - ie binary\nIt was an excellent teaching tool though. No distractions in the way of fancy GUIs and you had to concentrate on the job in hand.\nEveryone should be made to learn machine code programming first before high level languages. It makes you break problems down into the lowest level possible. It certainly makes you more concious that you are writing sloppy code in hll's  such as C.<\/font>\n<b>David Shepherd<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The picture you have is not of  this board as it was in 1979-84. I suspect  that this is of the  modern version which was clearly re-designed at what point in time I do not know. Although, the specification does appear to be identical; hopefully they have replaced the power regulator, which on the originals heated up to 70?C and you were advised not to touch it!<\/font>",

That's why Sinclair launches a new-look version of the Spectrum : the Spectrum+ was born.\nIn fact, it does not bring anything more apart from some cosmetic changes. Concerning the keyboard, the rubber keys are replaced with a better keyboard directly inspired by the keyboard of the QL, launched the same year. Though the keys are made of plastic this time, the touch is still a bit too soft. Fortunately, there are now a large spacebar, arrow keys and new editing keys.\nAlso added are two small feet under the keyboard, making it possible to tilt the keyboard at a convenient angle for typing, a bit like on modern PCs. A small reset button was also added on the left-hand side of the case, thus making it harder to press it accidentally.\nIn fact the Spectrum + largely adopts the look of the QL which is no coincidence at all, since apart from making the Sinclair product range more homogeneous aesthetically, it certainly represented advantages as far as the assembly lines were concerned.",

        "description": "This 6502 modular system was the first computer produced by Acorn in 1979. It was basically the same type of computer as competitors offered at that time (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=149\">KIM-1<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=961\">MK14<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=814\">Nascom<\/a>, etc...) : a 6502 or Z80 CPU (in this case, a 6502) mounted on a simple \"naked\" board, with a one-line display and a hexadecimal keyboard.\nThe System 1 is no exception : it featured an eight-digit seven-segment LED display, a hexadecimal keyboard (25 keys) and as there was no built-in BASIC in the computer, it had only machine-code.\nFortunately there was a tape-recorder interface communicating at 300 bauds. \nLike all these types of \"hobbyist\" computers, the main advantage was the expandability of the system. They were quite cheap machines because they were shipped basically \"naked\". Then you had to buy whatever cards you wanted (video, BASIC, sound, etc...). Here the system was Eurocard compatible, which was a well-known expansion board standard at that time.\nIf then you had \"too many\" expansion cards, a Eurocard rack was available to organise the whole system. \nThe System 1 itself was composed of two Eurocard boards (one for the CPU and the other for the keypad and display) mounted one above the other (sandwiched, you could say), the two being connected by a ribbon cable.",

But the hard-disk is said to be very noisy and the dual disks weigh more than 38 pounds!\nNearly all the hardware is housed within the monitor, a bit like a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=271\">Macintosh<\/a>. The separate keyboard is linked to the monitor by a \"not-long-enough\" cord. The 8\" disk-drive and hard-disk are mounted in a separate huge box. The 10MB hard drive for example was boxed with an 8\" drive. A real-time clock is included in the hardware. Green screens were available in all models since the screen\/processor case was common to all.\nLike its predecessor, the 820-II is well furnished in software of all sorts. Thanks to its CP\/M compatibility nearly every profession can find a suitable program. A lot of languages and OS were also available (CP\/M, Basic 80, C Basic 2, Assembler Macro 80, Cobol 80, Short 80, TTY communication, 3270\/3780 emulation).\nBut the 820-II has no real graphic possibilities nor sound, and a small RAM capacity (64 KB) for a professional computer. Above all it was quite expensive compared to its competitors.\nThere was also WP dedicated versions with unique key caps.\nA 16-bit expansion board was released to upgrade the 820-II, so that its performance would nearly match the new Xerox computer(the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=14\">16\/8<\/a>), and also allowed the 820 to work under DOS. At the start of the year 1985, Xerox would definately leave the micro-computer market and stop the production of the 820.\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Jeremy Wilcox, Bronislaw Opacki Jr<\/font>\n<b>Dale Carpenter<\/b> clarifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI started working for Xerox in 1983 as a PC tech in the Xerox Service Center a sevice\/support part to the retail store they had back then.\n820-II's were the next step after 820's they were already double density instead of upgraded like many 820's were. They also supported double sided drives.\nThe drive choices were 5.25\" dual drives single or double sided, 8\" dual drives also single or double sided and the top was a 8\"double sided floppy paired with a 8\" 10Mb Shugart hard drive.The 8\" double density, 2-sided floppies had a capacity of 960K which was a lot for back then.\n<\/font>",

        "description": "This stylishly designed computer had a speech recognition feature along with a microphone clipped on the left side of the LCD screen. \nAn article published in Personal Computer World in November 1984 explained how the voice recognition system works : \n<i>\n\"The voice system on the Portable allows you to have a vocabulary file of up to 4096 words. However, only 64 words can be held in RAM at any one time, so a fair amount of shuffling is necessary with large vocabularies. \nBefore the system can understand your commands, it is necessary to create a vocabulary file and train the system to understand your voice. The Portable is supplied with a program which allows this to be done.\nThe first thing to do is to create a vocabulary disk file. You can have as many of these as you like. The training program prompts for a name and then opens a diskfile underthat namewith a .VOC extension. Next you enter the words you want to use, along with an optional command which you want the machine to respond to. Once you have entered all the words, you can go into training mode. To do this you speak the words into the microphone and the program records the voice patterns. The more times you repeat each word the better the result. \nAfter you have trained all the words you can go on to see how well the machine understands you.\" <\/i>\nThe keyboard had no leads - it communicates with the main unit through infrared signals. But if you put an object in between the keyboard and the main unit, communication stops ! It was the same membrane keyboard as used with the Apricot F1.\nThere was also an optional and quite innovative trackball available, but a classic Microsoft mouse could also be used through the serial port. \nThe Apricot Portable shipped with the 'Activity' front-end to the operating system, an enhanced version of the one delivered with the Apricot F1. It was quite \"Mac\" influenced with icon-based navigation and even a built-in icon editor ! \nThe Apricot Portable was supplied with a great deal of bundled software : SuperWriter, SuperCalc, SuperPlanner, ACT Diary, ACT Sketch and an interactive tutorial. \nThe built-in disk-drive located at the right-hand side of the main unit was a Sony 3.5'' disk-drive, double-sided, 720k. ACT also supplied a little external 10 MB Rodime 3.5'' hard disk called an MSD (Mass Storage Device).\nThe large LCD was the first full 25-line liquid crystal screen to be mounted on a portable computer. It was made in Japan by Hitachi, but ACT wasn't happy with the controller, so it designed its own (very fast) display controller chip. It's possible to adjust the contrast by holding down the CTRL and UP-ARROW or DOWN-ARROW keys together, but the angle of the display is fixed and cannot be tilted.\nBut the Apricot Portable can also be connected to an external monitor and with the colour option, can display 640 x 256 pixels in eight colours from a palette of 16. In addition it is also possible to display data on both displays at the same time. For example, when using Supercalc 3 you could display the spreadsheet model on the LCD at the same time as displaying graphs or pie charts on the monitor ! \nThe Apricot Portable could only be powered by mains power, there was no battery option available at all. Quite strange for a \"portable\" computer... \nThe Apricot Portable did not meet with great success and was considered rather as a gadget, given its LCD screen and voice recognition features, but lacking real compatibility with other Apricot computers, in addition to its limited portability. \nThe price was cut down in 1985, and a new version with 512k RAM was sold. The 256k model was then called <b>FP-256<\/b>, and the 512k model <b>FP-512<\/b>.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=492\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Unlike the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=495\">Apricot F1<\/a> which was a kind of bridge between the home-computing and the professional markets, the F2 and the F10 were clearly marketed as business machines.\nThey were quite similar to the F1, but included an extra expansion slot, more memory and larger storage capacity : two disk-drives for the F2 and one disk-drive and a 10MB hard-disk for the F10. \nLike the F1, the F2 and F10 had an infra-red interface for the keyboard and the mouse\/trackball (the same infra-red mouseball pointing device used with the Apricot Portable). This interesting feature was not very convenient because you had to ensure that there was no object blocking the signals between the keyboard\/mouse and the computer, and you also had to power the keyboard with batteries! However, the systems originally shipped with a plastic light-pipe that could be connected between the keyboard and CPU so that obstacles would not block the signal. \nThe F2\/F10 were quite similar in shape to the F1. The same narrow, very deep and stylish case. The F10 had the same disk front-panel as the F1 but a different arrangement of the LED indicators (power, caps, disk, stop), infra-red sensors and logo. The F2 had different shaped disk-drives but identical LEDs, logo and infra-red sensors as the F1. \nThe F2 and the F10 use an Apricot-modified version of MS-DOS, so they were not really IBM compatible. \nThey were provided with a nice graphical and iconized interface called <b>Activity<\/b>. Integrated were a desktop, and software including a wordprocessor, communication, painting and Basic. They were also sold with GEM Write, GEM Paint and the GEM desktop.\nThese systems were quite expensive and not really IBM PC compatible, so they were not a great success, even in the UK, their native country.

        "description": "After the launch of the Apricot PC, largely inspired by the Victor S1 which sold well in the UK, ACT developed another computer, the Apricot F1. This new system was marketed equally as a business system and as a home-computer (with its TV video output for example). \nThe design of the F1 is quite innovative with its original shape and infrared keyboard. The main unit is much more deep than large, and the straight line of the whole system was quite stylish for the time. \nThere was no lead or cord between the keyboard and the main unit. All the communication was made through infrared signals. This is quite useful if you want to work from your sofa, four meters away from the main unit but you also must be sure that there is no obstacle between the keyboard and the infrared receivers located on the front of the main unit.\nThe Apricot F1 was however originally shipped with a plastic light-pipe that could be connected between the keyboard and CPU so that obstacles would not block the signal. Another drawback was that the keyboard had to be constantly powered with batteries!\nThis infrared feature is quite rare and the F1 is one of the only computers to be equiped with it, alongside the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=492\">ACT Apricot Portable<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=123\">Exelvision EXL-100<\/a> and a few others...\nJust above the quite comprehensive membrane keyboard are four small round buttons used to set the date and time of the internal clock, to change the rate of the keys auto-repeat feature, to lock the keyboard and to reset the computer. \nEven if the F1 used an 8086 it wasn?t really IBM PC compatible (though minor changes could make it BIOS compatible). The MS-DOS 2.11 used by the system is an Apricot modified version of the \"real\" MS-DOS. \nThe Apricot F1 was delivered with a nice icon-based graphical interface called \"Activity\" along with quality bundled sotfware for graphics, communication, wordprocessing and system tools. The same infra-red mouseball pointing device used with the Apricot Portable was available for the F1.\n \nAs the F1 was not IBM PC compatible and not particularly cheap, it didn't have great success outside its native country (UK). A slightly less expensive version was also released, labelled <b>F1e<\/b>. It was the same machine but the 720 KB floppy drive was replaced by a single sided 320 KB version. This version was about 300 Euros cheaper than the normal version.",

        "description": "This Polish computer was first introduced in fall 1983. As pretty much every\nsophisticated piece of hardware from the Eastern Block, it was copied from\na western computer. The ROM is based on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=243\">TRS-80 model II<\/a>, so the Meritum can be considered as a TRS-80 clone. It was mainly used in schools and is considered as the precursor of the polish computing industry as it was the first computer to be produced in Poland. \nIn fact the Meritum is not entirely Polish but rather a miracle of the eastern block industry : the keyboard and case is polish, disk-drives made in Hungary (some sources say Germany) and memory from Bulgary. 8'' disk-drives are said to be the Robotron K6500 ones...\nThe keyboard is quite special : left, right and down keys are situated on the right part of the keyboard whereas the up key is placed at the opposite left side !! Quite practical... Much weirder, two keys are blank !!\nThe Meritum has 64 graphic symbols. The Basic takes 12k of the 14k ROM. It is a  Tandy Basic modified to use polish letters (Model 2). Some keyboards have Cyrillic letters for the Soviet union instead of the Latin alphabet. The system uses a U880D microprocessor which is a East-German clone of the Z80.\nThere are two models, the Meritum model 2 having more memory (48k RAM) and higher resolutions than the model 1. It can be connected to external disk-drives and have a built-in disk controller. It can use polish alphabetical signs and has a parallel port.\nThe Model 1 which had no graphical resolution (only semi-graphic symbols), no colors, small memory and very high price, was not very popular and was considered obsolete even before being marketed !\nA Meritum III was released and shown on Poznan fair 1986, but apparently wasn't produced.\nAmong planned but never created accesories were: network interfaces ( this was actually produced for the II model ), and a expansion graphics processor that would in these days be called nothing more than a graphics accelerator :) Unfortunately, Mera was forced to suspend the productions of Meritums in favor to computer terminals etc. The whole assembly staff of the Meritum line was five people, and East Germany could not meet the demands for the 5,25\" disk drives that were needed for the Meritum II. Meritum was abandoned, as it couldn't compete with private imports of C64 and Atari computers.\n<font color=\"#666666\">If you find some info or know more about the Meritum computers, please mail us.<\/font>",

        "description": "This is a luggable IBM-PC compatible system. It tends to offer an all-in-one solution for the perfect 80's business man. Back in 1983 it was the first Japanese computer completely IBM-PC compatible (hardware &amp; software).\nIt has a built-in thermal printer (80\/132 columns, 8.5'' wide) using paper-rolls. This was quite useful where you were on the move, but the weight of the whole system is also quite impressive. It is maybe transportable but surely not portable !\nIt was also possible to connect a more sophisticated printer through the Parallel port.\nThere is a 9'' CRT green display built-in along with a brightness control.\nAn interesting feature is that you can also connect the Sr Partner to an external color monitor, thus unleashing the fantastic power of this ultra-modern laptop...err. Maybe not, but you can at least enjoy CGA color graphics (640 x 200 with 4 colors, wow).\nApparently there were several models with different storage configurations : one 5''1\/4 disk-drive (360k), two 5''1\/4 disk-drives, one disk-drive and one hard-disk (10Mb, 20Mb)...\nOn the original disk, the MS-DOS ver 2.0A and Basic v2.0 were delivered.\nPresented at the Las-Vegas Comdex in november 1983, the Senior Partner was proposed for 2495$ with Wordstar, Visicalc, PFS-File, PFS-Graph, PFS-Report and GW-Basic.\n<i>Panasonic, along with National and Technics  were brands owned by the Matsushita japanese group.<\/i>",

        "description": "After having imported the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=210\">Victor Sirius<\/a> for years in the UK, ACT produced its own computer largely inspired by the Sirius : the Apricot PC.\nIt was supposed to be transportable as there is a handle on the main-unit ! If you really want to move your Apricot this way, the keyboard can be clipped to the main-unit. \nSeveral features made this computer quite technically innovative :\n? the Apricot PC was possibly the first computer outside Japan to use 3.5'' disk-drives (315k or 720k),\n? the graphics quality and features were excellent (800 x 400) and came directly from the Victor Sirius,\n? the keyboard was quite original with 8 \"normal\" and 6 flat programmable function keys along with a built-in LCD screen (40 characters \/ 2 lines) which displayed the function of the keys. This feature was largely used by the included software, but not much by third-party software.\nThis small LCD screen could also display the current line of text you're working on and there's even a contrast knob on the right of the keyboard. \nIt's possible to transfer files and some software from a Sirius or an IBM PC to the Apricot PC by connecting them with a special cable.\nThere's also an IBM PC emulator which forces the Apricot to act like an IBM PC. It works well for some applications but not all. \nSome software was supplied with the Apricot PC : Supercalc, various system tools, asynchronous communication, IBM-PC emulator, Microsoft Basic-86, Basic Personal and ACT Manager (a graphical interface for MS-DOS). Word, Multiplan, Wordstar, dBase II, C-Pascal, Pascal UCSD, C, Fortran, Cobol and Basic Compiler 5.35 were available optionally.\n \nIn 1984, ACT launched new versions of the Apricot PC with built-in hard-disks and a different colour case. They were called <a href=\"computer.asp?c=500\">Apricot Xi<\/a>.\n_______________________\nAbout IBM\/PC compatibility, <b>Greg Taylor<\/b> specifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nConcerning the early Apricot PCs (including the Xi) the reason they could not run all MS-DOS programs is that while they came with a copy of MS-DOS, they did not have an identical BIOS so any calls to specific BIOS modules could often fail.\nFor example, dBase III could not run (on mine anyway) but a competitor product called (I think) DBXL did run.  That apart, they were very nice computers for their time with 3.5\" disks (nearly everyone else was still using 5.25\") and high-quality graphics.<\/font>\n<b>Ian Foggon<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The original Apricot PC also came in another flavour you have not listed. It was possible to have these units upgraded to 286 IBM compatible standard by Apricot UK.  This involved the replacement of the motherboard and the addition of a 20Mb Miniscribe HDD in the place of one of the Sony 3.5? FDDs. My Father had this done to his Apricot PC back in 1988. These units had their own specially written manuals, and the keyboards were re-keyed to make them IBM compatible too.<\/font>",

A handle then slid out of the front (just under the ridge) that allowed it to be carried very easily.\nA colour screen was available - a re-packaged 10\" Sony Trinitron screen that almost nobody bought because it was so expensive.\nThe mono screens had an anti-glare coating consisting of a very fine nylon mesh stretched over the screen and held in place by the bezel. Anybody who made the mistake of spraying glass cleaner on it would regret it, as the cleaner just clogged up in the pores of the mesh and left a nasty stain on the screen, which could only be removed by dismantling the monitor in order to rinse the mesh in water.\nModel Xi5 : 256 KB RAM + 5 MB hard-disk + 315k disk-drive\nModel Xi10 : 256 KB RAM + 10 MB hard-disk + 720k disk-drive\nModel Xi20 : 512 KB RAM + 20 MB hard-disk + 720k disk-drive\nModel Xi20s : 1 MB RAM + 20 MB hard-disk + 720k disk-drive\nThere was also a very rare model - coloured pale grey, which had a hard drive of 50 MB or thereabouts. \n<b>Dave Ridley<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Used to fix these machines, one very common problem on Apricot Xi was \"wobbly screen\" reported by user. The answer was to make a \"bacofoil sandwich\" as we called it! Take one aluminum foil strip, cover with packing tape to insulate, solder an earth wire onto one corner and stuff inside case, under where the screen sat. Hey presto, no wobble induced by PSU in main unit! Also the disk drives were prone to clogging up and getting generally dirty.<\/font>\nTechnical tip from <b>Charles Verrier<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nTaking any Apricot PC to bits required a bit of care...\nThe rear panel had 3 or 4 screws, one of which fitted into the metal 'bridge' that ran the width of the machine, and held the PSU and disk drives above the motherboard, which filled the base of the case.\nThe bridge was partially supported by this real-panel screw, and would drop about half a centimetere when it was removed.\nThe only way to reassemble the thing was to turn the unit upside down so that the bridge screw hole would re-align with the real panel.\nHappy days!\n\t\n<\/font>",

It had the same features as the IBM PC (360 KB disks, identical graphic resolution) but had a different CPU, the 8086 which was a true 16-bit processor, for a much lower price !\nThe Advance 86 was totally IBM PC compatible, from the keyboard, the disks, the resolution, to the expansions which could be used with the Advance through four IBM-compatible slots.\nIn fact, the Advance 86 was first conceived as a home-computer (model <b>86A<\/b>) and was later upgraded with a ''new box'' housing the two disk-drives, the expansion slots and thus the IBM compatibility features (model <b>86B<\/b>). This is why the model 86B is composed of two main cases, the smallest one being the original one (86A) which houses the main board and has a wide trap-door to store the keyboard when not in use.\nBack in 1984, the Advance 86 was one of the few professional systems to work without any fan thanks to its dual power supply unit, making work more pleasant. However, a fan was later added into the lower case.\nThe Advance 86B was sold with four professional software packages: Perfect Writer, Perfect Speller, Perfect Calc and Perfect File. This bundle had everything a new user needed to start, and it was great value as it all came free with the computer ! \nA 10 MB hard-disk was quickly sold in option, as the disks had a low capacity (360k), like the IBM PC.\nA kit form was also available at a reduced price for self build.",

        "description": "This computer was called \"Yablotchko\" (small apple) by the westerners as this is a poor copy of the Apple II. And to prove that the Agat is really copied on the Apple, the ROM still has Steve Wozniak's name in memory ! Its operating system and ROM are nearly identical to the Apple II's, but instead of a single board, it uses several chip modules.\nAgat was produced in a military company based in Moscow called \"LEMZ\" which stands for \"Linozovo (district in Moscow) electronics-mechinical manufacturer\". They started producing it in 1985, although prototypes were available in 1984 or probably erlier. Designers of that computer were actually hobbysts and LEMZ picked their design when managers from that company came across Agat designers at an exhibition.\nElorg didn't produce any Agat systems. They were just the exclusive distributer of Russian microelectronics products outside of USSR, and as matter of fact tried to promote Agats in Eastern Europe...\nAgat was built first around a multi-chip processor, clone of one of the LSI-11 processors, but then a real MOS6502 was used. The system is composed of three parts : a screen, a keyboard and a central unit. The screen is in fact a real 30cm Secam (russian standard) television, which is connected to the computer through a 1m long cord (DIN9). The keyboard is composed of cyrillic and latin keys (33 keys) plus function keys and a numeric keypad. It uses the layout of the standard Russian typewriter.\nThere is a built-in 5??1\/4 disk-drive into the right part of the central unit. The operating system is not exactly the same as the Apple OS and it?s impossible to start an Apple II with this OS nor an Agat with the Apple OS. On the other hand, once the OS is loaded, it?s possible to read the same disk or run the same programs on both systems. But there were some serious incompatibility problems with first models.\nThere is no way to add a second disk-drive as there is no other connector apart from monitor, keyboard, printer and cassette interface. In the same way, there are no way to expand the original 64k RAM...\nThe Agat can operate under three graphic modes : low, medium and high, which are compatible with the Apple?s graphic features. The cyrillic characters displayed on the screen are said to have been conceived by the russian engineers with the Apple Tool Kit. \nIt was principally meant for education and was the object of some important early educational experimentats such as ?Schkol'nitza? which took place in a Novosibirsk school. Schkol'nitza, which means schoolgirl in russian, was a system developped to assist the teacher in its classroom. It was composed of several Agat computers and software packages. The teacher, who had a computer, a printer and the disks, could command all the network to ask questions, correct the answers, display maps or what he wanted on the pupils' screens. \nIt seems like Elorg and the USSR had plans to export the Agat for $17000 ! ! Quite expensive for a bad Apple II clone...\nAt that time it was impossible for a normal citizen to buy a micro-computer for its own use as all the computers there were for the education, the army, the research or some privileged persons...\nThe original Agat was followed by several other models, from which the <b>Agat-7<\/b> and the <b><a href=\"computer.asp?c=510\">Agat-9<\/a><\/b>.\nThe Agat-7, conceived in 1986, introduced the expansion feature which was the main weakness of the original Agat and had an optional full Apple compatibility card available.\nThe Agat-9, produced a bit later, was a fully compatible Apple II+ system with real expansion possibilities (6 non-apple compatible slots). It was then possible to find memory expansion cards, serial cards, additional disk-drives and even network cards. In fact the Agat-9 was also compatible with the more exotic Pravetz-8 and Tzyntzy computers.",

Xenix was the Microsoft \"adaptation\" of Unix.\nThis system was quite well designed with its squashed hexagon shaped box and its thin monitor. These were medium-sized desktop cases, usually beige but often came in custom colors. \nA fully-loaded 586 contained four printed-circuit boards.\nThe main board held the 80186 and 512 KB of RAM; a Z80 I\/O processor supporting six serial I\/O ports, floppy disc access, and an RN422 LAN; and sundry memory management components allowing the 586 to support Xenix.\nA second board held a hard disk and tape controller with an Intel 8089 I\/O processor\nAn optional communication board provided an Ethernet chipset and processors supporting either the X25 or SNA protocols, or four additional serial I\/O ports.\nThe fourth board was an optional  memory expansion board providing an additional 512 KB of RAM.\nIt had a 5''1\/4 disk-drive built-in on the right part of the front panel, and a hard-disk on the left part.\nA real-time clock was included with the system. There were 128 semi-graphic symbols available.\nThe <b>Altos 686<\/b> appears to be the same machine as the 586, but with an 80286 processor.\nAltos also produced an 8-bit version of this system, called the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=516\">ACS-580<\/a>.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=515\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was sold as an add-on for the Japanese Famicom (but can't be connected to a NES as it lacks the Famicom's Expantion Port).\nIn fact the system is composed of three parts : the Famicom, the keyboard and the Basic cartidge.\nThe keyboard is connected to the expansion port situated at the front of the Famicom. Then a Basic cartridge must be inserted into the Famicom catridge slot. As the keyboard is almost \"empty\", most of the Famicom's hardware is used, along with the Basic cartridge RAM chips.\nThe Basic delivered with the keyboard is the NS-HUBASIC, where \"N\" stands for Nintendo, \"S\" for Sharp and \"HU\" for Hudson, as they all contributed to this project.\nOnce inserted there is only 1982 bytes free to play with ! But it was possible to back-up the program into the cartridge itself by powering it with 3 battery cells. This saving method wasn't reliable as quite often the programs were lost because of bad contacts...\nHopefully, a tape-recorder was available, but there again, the adjustment of the input level was quite difficult to get.\nSome games using the built-in save\/load feature of the Basic cartridge were released such as \"Lode Runner\" (edit mode) and \"Challenge Race\".\nThe catalog number of the keyboard is HVC-007.",

No more cursed 3\" disks that were so hard to find in 85 because nobody else was using them. \nThe keyboard was exactly the same as the 6128. But if you look at the connections you can see MIDI plugs and a RS232 connector ! Alan Sugar tries to implement some real standards at last... Clearly, Amstrad wanted to prepare for the 16\/32 bit battle, declared with the soon-to-be-launched Atari 520ST, but with an old Z80!! A lost cause from the start... \nThe RAM is not really 512k, but rather like its brother the 6128, there were several banks used as virtual RAM disks : 5 banks of 94 k each + the initial 42 k .\n \nThere were new BASIC instructions: CIRCLE, PAINT, SCROLL, CLOCK, MUSIC, etc. and many others to control communication with the RS232 connector. \nThe 5512 had its own internal clock that would keep time even after the computer was switched off. Wow!\nBut most impressive was the GUI. Yes, there was a real Graphical User Interface like Windows !! But it was slow, the Z80 could not perform miracles. \nOf course it was fully compatible with the other CPCs. \n<b>OK, IT'S A JOKE ! Hebdogiciel (a very well known French newspaper\/magazine in the 80's) made this joke on the first page of N?138 in June 85. AMSTRAD took them to court asking for 100 million francs in damages,  arguing that this joke stopped the sales of the 6128 for one week, which may have been true... <\/b>",

People who upgraded from the classic C64 couldn't play their games stored on tapes !\nSome programs that used the tape buffer for storage (of sprites say) had problems too.\nThe cartridge slot is found on top of the case, and there is a sound speaker inside the unit (unlike the C64).\nThe DX-64 has the same characteristics as the SX64 except its two 5.25\" floppy disk drives instead of one. A very small quantity was produced. It was probably never sold but only used by Commodore insiders.\nThe SX64 and DX64 computers never had success, probably because of higher selling prices, but were known as the world's first color portables.\nThe SX64 was not the only machine that Commodore made in this chassis, there was also the SX500, which was an Amiga in the SX case (see 'More pictures').",

Development started in 1975 and by 1977 the first units of the J100 were installed.\nThe base unit included two 8\" single-sided floppy drives and could be expanded to up to 14 users. The OS was Jacquard's own DOS. The CPU of the J100 was National Semiconductor's IMP16 microprocessor and the J500 - a follow-on single-user system - was implemented using the AMD Bit-slice technology CPU architecture. The J500, thus a multifunction monopost system, could be used for wordprocessing, mass-mailing, accountancy or stock control.\nThe J505 version featured the same motherboard plus a piggyback that allowed 2 additional terminals to be connected.\nThe AM Jacquard J-500 was composed of a central unit keyboard\/monitor and two disk-drives. From 1 to 4 optional hard-disks could be added. The hard drives were the Pertec 14\"  with (I think) 10MB fixed and 5MB removable ans also the Control Data 14\" 80MB drive.\nThe parallel printer port was a 12-bit port, unlike the standard 8-bit Centronics. The Xerox Diablo 1640 daisy wheel printer could be attached to it as well as many other printers.\nThe J500 was unique at its time because all of the CPU and ALU was stored and executed from a bank of 32 Proms (Programable Read Only Memory). The J100 could actually handle 64 interupts.This included stations and printers. It was limited to 16 because of hashing.\nDisplay was performed by the same ROM\/microcode\/ALU that provided the main\nprocessing, timesliced in alternate 'quads' - 4 microcode instructions per\nprocess cycle.\nSpecial thanks to <b>Randy Larson<\/b> who sent us many pictures and information.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=527\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

This hard-disk was half thinner than \"classic\" hard-disks of that time (Slimline technology).\nIt also had a color graphic board but the  built-in monitor was monochrome (no color model was available). It was not completely useless as it enabled to display 8 shades of green... Hopefully it was possible to connect an external color monitor !\nThe Eagle Spirit was really IBM PC compatible (hardware &amp; software) and could be booted with the original IBM PC boot disks. The disks capacity and format procedure were the same.\nThe graphic resolution was the same as the IBM PC: 320 x 200 with a character matrix of 7 by 9 pixels.

The <a href=\"computer.asp?c=529\">Eagle PC<\/a>, launched one year earlier, had a high resolution of 720 x 352 with a character matrix of 11 x 19 pixels!\nFirst models had different keyboards where you had to press CONTROL+ALT+N to activate the numeric keypad. Later models had IBM PC style keyboards with LED signals.\nAs the Eagle spirit weights 15kg, a transport suitcase was available!\n<b>H. Mitchell<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nIn 1983, I bought an Eagle Spirit (transportable) and still have it. It was self-contained in metal luggage. We called these luggables. The Spirit accepted 2(then new) 256k chips and ran both CP\/M and DOS. I had 512kb of RAM. Because of a copyright battle they had to change their BIOS (which was almost 100% compatible with IBM's) to another spec which didn't work quite as well. When the stock went public it went sky high. Later, the founder was killed in an auto crash and the stock cratered.<\/font>\n<b>Bob Whipple<\/b>'s memories:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI had an Eagle Spirit lent me by my father in law; I wrote a PhD dissertation on this computer in 1988-1990, and later used it in my first teaching job.\nIt was not too temperamental, was pretty reliable (starting up, the HDD sounded like a jet taking off), and had 2 floppy drives and a 20 MB HDD. It was robust for that time, and though quite heavy, in those days any computer approaching \"portability\" was a Godsend.\nThe keyboard attached to the front, covering the floppy drives and tiny monitor; the black plastic handle was in the back.  One had exercise caution in carrying it so as not to bump it against doorframes and the like, which ran the risk of putting the hard disk out of whack.\nA good old machine.<\/font>",

        "description": "The PC 6300 was in fact an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=535\">Olivetti M24<\/a> sold under the ATT brand.\nLaunched a few months after the presentation of six new UNIX super-micro and mini ATT computers (march 1984), the PC 6300 was the first ATT system to be IBM PC compatible. It represented the low-end system of the ATT products.\nBut the PC-6300 (and the Olivetti M24) was an excellent PC compatible system, twice faster than the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=286\">IBM PC XT<\/a> computer thanks to a real 16 bit CPU, the Intel 8086, which ran at 8Mhz as opposed to the 8088 of the IBM PC running at 4,7Mhz. The standard graphic possibilities were also better than those of the IBM PC.\n<b>Michael Hildenbrand<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">When I got it, there was also an option to get a 720k 3.5\nfloppy with it instead of the 5.25 floppy. When I got mine in 1986, one of the 5.25 floppy drives went bad and I had them replace it under warranty. It would have cost me $500 to replace it if I had had to replace it. Cool machine, anyway. I used that machine for many years!<\/font>\n<b>David Punia<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nDuring the early 80's, it became apparent that PC's were becoming an important tool to engineers and to businesses. The University of Vermont, where I worked at the time, was an early adopter of what later became common practice, that of requiring incoming students in certain disciplines to purchase personal computers.\nIn those days, compatibility was a huge issue, i.e. there was very little, so sole-source vendors were often chosen to supply PC's. The AT&amp;T PC6300 offered a significant performance advantage over the IBM PC and others. It's full 16-bit processor\/bus interface, 8 MHz processor, high resolution graphics modes (proprietary to Olivetti\/AT&amp;T) and 8087 math coprocessor socket made it a good choice for CAD, circuit analysis, and other graphical and math-intensive applications. There were a couple of 16-bit expansion slots also, but the card configuration was proprietary, eventually supplanted by the PC\/AT's form factor for expansion cards.\nThe design of the chassis was interesting; the motherboard was accessed by removing the bottom cover of the system unit, exposing the entire motherboard. A daughterboard in the upper section of the system unit carried hardware for the expansion slots, and housed the drives. I still have one of these boxed away in my basement, with a side-attached hard drive chassis that could carry a full-height 5.25\" hard disk. Mine has a 72 MB Seagate, about 5 pounds and $650 at the time, that dims the lights while it spins up ;-). and makes a loud clunk when the mechanical brake kicks in during power down.\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The last computer made by Symag presents an original concept : using the same central unit, user can choose between several processors. Back then, the Symag chairman said : \"No other computer in the world combines as much innovative features\". And indeed, on the paper, the Orchydee was very promising, being, for example, power-cut proof.\nThe basic model is provided with either an 8 bits Z80 microprocessor, or a 16 bits 80186, thus allowing the system to be used with 8 bits and 16 bits O.S. (CP\/M, CP\/M86 or MS-DOS). Each microprocessor is delivered in a cartridge to be inserted in front of the computer. Smaller ROM software cartridges can also be inserted into this bigger cartridge. The 80186 version of the Orchidee is partially compatible with PC standard.\nThe Orchyd?e was first presented at the SICOB show (Paris, France) in october 83, but in june 84 not a single computer has been sold ! Indeed in may 84, the Symag loss are equal to 4 millions FF, for a turnover of 25 millions FF instead of the 38 millions FF planned. This brutal change is officialy due to a subcontractor failing, which prevented the Orchyd?e from being produced. The failure concerns the main case of the Orchyd?e. Christian Coeur, the Sales Manager, says : \"We have been betrayed by one of our suppliers who couldn't fulfill our quality requests. It was then necessary to find another subcontractor to replace the first one\".\nAnother official explanation was : \"Before the SICOB 83 we had 4 persons working nights and days on the Orchyd?e and thanks to them we could present the project on time at the Show. But after that we employed 15 persons who were finishing work at 5.00 PM (!), and the four guys of the beginning were on the road to promote the product. Realize the we had 50 millions francs worth of placed orders, and we didn't fulfilled any !\"\nBut unofficialy, the true explanation is that all the innovative features announced could not be totally realised in laboratories :\n- first, only one ROM cartridge out of the many promised was effetively produced, and it was only used to start the MOTUS wordprocessor, which was partially stored on a floppy disk (!).\n- Symag encountered many technical problems conceiving the promised high-resolution monochrom monitor, and the solution was only found after the company went bankrupt.\n- Symag had also quite a lot of difficulties to implement the 80186 cpu working at 8 Mhz, and the first Orchyd?es equiped with this CPU were only delivered after the bankruptcy.\n- the 13Mb hard-disk : Symag chosed a common controler (hard-disk &amp; floppies) which creates 8 sectors per track on the floppies, whereas the controler implemented on the models without the hard-disk, creates 9 sectors per track. The result is that floppies created on one model couldn't be read by an other ! Symag had to send technicians to modify the ROMs of each Orchyd?es sold (not that many you will tell me)...\n- the power-cut security feature : Symag promised a way to save the work in progress in case of power cut. In fact only 256 bytes could be saved, which was of course not enough to save the user work in progress.\nThus, whereas the production should have started from january 84, it is still not operative in june 84. The objective of 1000 Orchyd?es produced in 1984 is logicaly reduced to 500, and investors start to be more than upset.\nMoreover, the original concept of the Orchyd?e will not be enough to insure commercial success compared to cheaper PC &amp; compatible computers, and the Symag company, based in Grenoble (France), will collapse a few months later. Indeed in June 1984 Symag goes bankrupt and while the company is restructured in a 3 companies holding, Control Data is chosen to produce 60 Orchyd?es a month from September. Only high-end models with hard-disks and color monitors will be produced.",

The first machines used 8-inch floppy drives, later upgraded to 5-1\/4-inch units and, eventually, to 5- or 10-MB Winchester hard disks, keeping a floppy drive for data backup.\nThe picture shows a late-model (1985) terminal; that casing, designed by Brascom's industrial director (nickname Bubby), earned him a prominent design award. Unlike previous models, this one was capable of displaying graphic characters such as lines, corners and blocks.\nIn 1985, Brascom introduced a 6-MHz Z80B-based microcomputer running the CP\/M operating system. This computer, called Foxy, was equipped with the above-mentioned late-model encasing and two external 5-1\/4-inch floppy drives. This product never quite made it, due to Brascom's increasing financial problems and its final closedown in about 1986.\nThanks to <b>Claudio Chagas<\/b> for all this information.\nPicture : <a href=\"http:\/\/orbita.starmedia.com\/~cobit\/\" target=\"_blank\">Club Old Bits<\/a>",

        "description": "This is a highly IBM PC compatible system. It means that it is truely hardware and sotfware compatible with the IBM PC of that time. Back then, all \"PC compatible\" systems were not exactly 100% compatible... so it was a real marketing argument for the Olivetti M24.\nThere were two true tests to know if a system was really IBM PC compatible : Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Flight Simulator, and the M-24 was running both with no problem.\nBut in addition to its good compatibility, the Olivetti M24 was offering more than the IBM PC itself : RS232c and Centronics interface built-in, more complete keyboard, better graphic possibilities (640 x 400) and 7 free expansion slots (instead of 3 for the IBM PC). Even the CPU (8086, real 16-bit) was faster than the 8088 (16-bit with an 8-bit bus) used by the IBM PC.\nIt runs under MS-DOS 2.11, CP\/M 86, UCSD P-System and even PCOS, the Olivetti OS used on the M20.\nThe 128k RAM can be expanded to 256k or 640k by adding memory directly onboard. It is also possible to connect two optional 10 Mb hard disks (one internal and one external).\nThe Olivetti M24 was sold with a green or yellow phosphore 12\" monochrome monitor, or with a color monitor (more expensive, of course). Two keyboards were available : one absolutly identical to the IBM PC's, and an Olivetti with more keys (102 instead of 83) including 18 functions keys and a complete editing keypad.\nIn September 85 appears a new model, the <b>M24 SP<\/b>. It is based on a M24 but its Intel 8086 is running at 10 Mhz, it has 512k RAM (still upgradable to 640k) and a 20Mb hard-disk.\nConclusion : the Olivetti M24 was the first computer to be fully compatible with the IBM PC and to offer more features than original PC, for a cheaper price !\nThe Olivetti M24 was also sold as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=154\">Logabax 1600<\/a> in France (Olivetti owned Logabax) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=531\">ATT PC-6300<\/a>in the USA (Olivetti signed a distribution deal with ATT).

It was primarly produced in Augsburg Germany.\nIt was 80286 based and clocked the CPU at 8 MHz max. With the PC8, NCR offered their NCR-DOS, but also a UNIX variant (Xenix).\nThe system was bundled with NCR-DOS, GW-BASIC, Getting Started booklet, On-line NCR HELP, NCR User Interface, and User Diagnostics.\nBetter pictures needed !\n<b>Ryan May<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The PC8 had several varieties.  The PC8 on NCRs site was always refered to by a tier number and a model number, NCR themselves rarely use the PCX to identify a unit.\nBoth units I got had a stock 20mb MFM hard drive (NCR labled), two\n5.25\" HD floppies, and 640kb RAM on the system board (though there were checkboxs on the front panel of the unit for 256kb, 512kb, 1512kb).\nThere was a front panel you could fold down that had a checklist of\nall the possible items that could be installed in the unit. Also under the front panel was a volume control for the pcspeaker.\nBoth units also had a 15\" NGA?? (NCR proprietary video) monitor. I really\nwanted to use the screens because they were very high quality. I ran all\nsorts of diagnostics and nothing seemed to know what they where, all said\nCGA and the only video mode that I could get to work was CGA. BUT!!\nBy appearance, in text mode the screens appeared to be VGA or even SVGA in\nthe 80x25 text mode. I have never seen monitors that where that clear.\nThey where 16 color or possibly 64 color ttl.\nOne utility I used thought the screens where 640x400, which is what I\nassume to be correct. The text (in text mode) looked like Modern, it was\nvery thin and very clear\/smooth, much different than I am used to.<\/font>\n<b>Omer van der Horst Jansen<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">The PC8 was designed before thumbscrews were common in PC case design. To help you to open the case it came with a nifty NCR-branded screwdriver that could be flipped for use with Phillips and regular screws.

        "description": "The Cosmac VIP, originaly named VP-111, is a typical hobbyist \"single-board\" computer sold as a kit. You had to build it yourself ! The system uses a RCA CDP-1802 microprocessor like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=728\">RCA Studio II<\/a> video game system. In fact the Studio II is very similar to the VIP and can be considered as its video-game version. But the VIP is also somehow an improved version of the original Cosmac Elf board system, described in Popular Electronics magazine, august 76 and the following months. The CDP-1802 CPU was also used as the heart of the Voyager, Viking and Galileo probes ! Until recently the 1802 was quite popular (for alarm systems for example) thanks to its CMOS technology ideal for low power systems.\nThe Cosmac VIP has a most basic hexadecimal keyboard (16 keys). The language stored in ROM is called CHIP-8 and is only 512 bytes long ! It consists of 31 instructions each of which is two bytes (or four hex digits) long. It's a kind of simplified machine language. 16 one-byte variables are provided. Subroutine nesting and machine language inserts are permitted. CHIP-8 was quite popular at that time (Telmac 1800, ETI 660 and DREAM 6800 used it) as it allowed to program video games easily. CHIP-8 was not only used in the late 70's and early 80's. It was used in the early 90's on the HP48 calculator because there was no programming tools to develop fast games on it. Then, a better version of CHIP-8 appeared: SUPER-CHIP. This interpreter has all the CHIP-8 features, as well as and some new ones like a 128*64 resolution (source : David Winter).\nRCA also sold Tiny Basic, a simple Basic interpreter, as a 4K ROM on an expansion board.\nWith this system, basic functions are : type programs into RAM from the hex keyboard, save and load programs on tapes, display memory bytes in hex on CRT, step through RAM contents and examine microprocessor registers. Wow.\nThe Cosmac VIP is equiped with a sound chip and a real-time crystal clock. The sound produced can be heard through the tape output connector. It was delivered with some documentations (CHIP-8, machine language) and listings of 20 video games !\nTo the left of the hexadecimal keyboard are a reset switch and LED indicators for power-on and cassette operation. Memory add-ons, expansion port and parallel interface are pre-wired on the motherboard but have to be implemented as options. With the I\/O interface, you could connect interface relays, sensors, printers or ASCII keyboards.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=543\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

M.G.T. was already known in the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX Spectrum<\/a> world for a range of hardware that they sold. The Sam was their pride and joy, and unfortunately to be their downfall.\nThis was a time when the 16-bit machines, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari ST<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=65\">Amiga<\/a>, were really being to take off. Sales in computers such as the Spectrum was in rapid decline. The Sam was aimed to fill this gap, a powerful 8-bit machine with specs that in cases out performed those of the 16-bit machines, at an 8-bit price. It was hoped that current 8-bit owners, particularly Spectrum owners, would jump on the nicely priced Sam rather than a more expensive 16-bit machine.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=545\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Announced November 1982, the unit was actually shipped in January of 1983 (300 of them). This was arguably the system that destroyed IBM's monopoly on the PC market and created the situation we see today.  It WAS the first compatible system that was LEGALLY made, though Columbia first copied the IBM BIOS and later paid the fatal price.\nThe system's BIOS was developed from scratch by using a team of 18 persons (only one guy was \"dirty\" and he was not allowed to do any part of the code and could only answer vaguely to questions). They took IBM's BIOS apart and made notes of the system calls contained within it. That way, Compaq was able to develop a PC compatible without any risk of a lawsuit from IBM, since the code was written from scratch (reverse engineering). It cost them $1 million to do it.\nThe system itself weighs a hefty 34 pounds and was dubbed a 'luggable' computer\nrather than a true portable. It contained a 9\" green phosphor CRT display and both serial and parallel ports. The system did MDA graphics as well as CGA by switching the scan frequencies of the monitor (a first that is the basis for VGA).\nThe only difference between the standard and 'Plus' models was that the latter had a single 5.25\" floppy drive and a 10Mb hard disk, while the original model had two 5.25\" drives. All units supported two 5.25'' floppies at 160 KB, 320 KB and 360 KB. All units could have 10, 20, or 30 MB hard drives but Compaq only shipped 10MB Rhodime ruggedized drives (good for 40 G shock!). Some models also had a 20\/40 MB tape drive. Compaq also shipped a brown nylon or brown leather carrying case and ONE blue case (Rod Canions unit).\nIn its first year of trading, Compaq took more than $111 million on this single\nproduct, which was a US business record. During that year (1983), more than\n53,000 units were sold.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Museum entry added by David Wyn Davies\nThanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/~compcloset\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Closet Museum<\/a> for the picture.\n<\/font>\n<b>Dave<\/b> (Compaq insider) reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The portable was the first unit and had silver logo plates. It had the standard 1 or 2 floppy drives. The Plus was the unit with the Rhodime 10MB fixed disk and had gold labels. Many folks get them confused as the Portable was easily upgradable to a Plus and many thousands were. Just check the label color.\nOh here's a tidbit - to remove the case cover, simply lay the unit flat (fold up the bottom feet) and press your elbow into the middle of the top cover and the rear edge of that cover will pop out enough to grab and lift off. One of the test ladies taught me that and we were all muscling it around - she simply figures out how to use what she has.\nThe power supply can be a bugger to remove also. It had a special wrench to remove the lower lock screw and the whole thing kinda slides out where you can then remove the connectors.\nMy unit had 2 1\/2 ht 20 Mg drives and 2 1\/2 ht floppy drives. I later swapped a floppy for a tape drive. It is presently in the Compaq internal museum (the \"hall of fame\").<\/font>\n<b>Paul Dixon<\/b> (another Compaq insider) replies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The cover actually can be removed with one hand if you know exactly where to slap the heel of your hand onto the cover and then catch the edge as it pops out with your fingers.\nGraphic modes are shown here as CGA and MDA.  Actualy can MDA be described as a graphics mode?  I suppose if you count lines produced in text mode then it could be. However the Compaq portable did NOT support MDA (or Mode 7).  It emulated MDA in CGA mode 3 which is the text mode for CGA. <\/font>",

        "description": "Despite its name, the Kaypro II was the first Kaypro model. The name was KAYPRO II, because the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> was the most popular system (besides the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a>) around back then, and Kaypro decided to follow in the image. \nIt was conceived by Non Linear Systems inc., a company with over 30 years' experience of producing small portable aerospace electronic equipment, which would later become Kaypro. \nThe Kaypro systems were known to be square-built ! All the hardware is packed into a solid aluminum case. These computers can resist to a lot of trouble as they proved when ten of them (Kaypro IV &amp; 10) were used by doctors for the Paris-Dakar 84's edition. Non of them failed despite extreme conditions.\nOne asset of the Kaypro, over the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=181\">Osborne 1<\/a> which was\navailable at about the same time, is the 9\" built-in monitor, easily twice\nthe size of the Osborne's. Though the Kaypro 2 has no graphic features, it can display 80 x 24 characters. There are two single-sided \/ double-density full-heigth 5.25'' disk-drives (190k each). One can be used to boot CP\/M and the other to run the software.\nThe Kaypro II is a real \"luggable\" system. Even if it weights more than 10kg, it can be easily moved with the handle found at the back.\nAt the rear of the system, one can find a serial port, a parallel port, a keyboard connector, a brightness control knob and reset button.\nPerfect Writer, Perfect Calc, Perfect Filer, Perfect Speller, S-Basic, CP\/M and Profitplan were bundled with the system. Later WordStar was also available.\nAs usual with Kaypro, the model names logic is quite dramatic to resolve. Several Kaypro \"2\" were marketed :\n- In 1984 a new <b>Kaypro 2<\/b> (refered as Kaypro 2'84) is introduced. It has two SS\/DD half-height floppy drives, a Z-80A running at 4.0 MHz, 2 serial ports and rudimentary graphics (through graphic characters).\n- The same year, the <b>Kaypro 2X<\/b> is released. Very similar to a Kaypro 2'84 but with DS\/DD half-height drives.\n- Still in 1984, in order to be compatible with IBM software, a special version was marketed with an Intel 8088 CPU instead of the Z80A. It was called the <b>Kaypro II Plus 88<\/b>!\n- In 1985 another Kaypro 2 refered as <b>\"New 2\"<\/b> is sold. It is basically an old 2X motherboard, with one or two DS\/DD floppy drives, but no 300 baud modem previously found on the 2X. It comes with just CP\/M and Wordstar for software.\n- And to spice up a bit things, Kaypro decides to rename its <a href=\"computer.asp?c=548\">Kaypro 4'84<\/a> as <b>Kaypro 2X<\/b> (sometimes also known as 2X MTC), thus dropping the previous 2X model!\nSee ! I told you...\nTrivia :\n<font color=\"#666666\">In 1985, <b>Arthur C. Clarke<\/b> published a sequel to 2001 : 2010 Odyssey Two. He worked with Peter Hyams in the movie version of 2010. Their work was done using a Kaypro computer and a modem, for Arthur was in Sri Lanka and Peter Hyams in Los Angeles. Their communications turned into the book The Odyssey File - The Making of 2010.\n_________\nThanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bolo.ch\" target=\"_blank\">Bolo's Computer Museum<\/a> for the picture.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=550\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Series 16 computers were originally designed by Computer Control Company, which was then bought by Honeywell in 1966. \nSeries 16 computers were used in a wide range of applications. Many were used in computer control applications, and many educational establishments used them as general purpose computers. \nThe most prominent application of them relates to the origins of the internet. The DDP-516 was used as the basis of \"Interface Message Processors\" or IMPs that were used to connect the very first networked computers to the ARPANET. \nThe DDP-516, introduced in 1966, and the later H316, which has an identical instruction set, form the core of the Series-16. The DDP-116 is clearly the forerunner of these machines, but seems to have had a limited impact commercially. The DDP-416 appears to be a development that is off the main path for the Series 16. The H716 seems to have come too late to be commercially successful.\nThanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sapere.demon.co.uk\/computers\/honeywell.html\" target=\"_blank\">Adrian Wise<\/a> for this information.\nAbout this computer, <b>Mr. Richard Pearson<\/b> said us:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The picture is copied from the programming manual of the second computer that I was associated with, in 1966. The Honeywell DDP-516 was chosen for its high clock speed (aprox. 1.1 MHz) and expandability to 32 K of 16 bit words. Card and paper tape readers were the initial inputs with mag tape drives added as the system development progressed.  The final configuration included a hard disc drive the size of a large upright freezer.  Assorted special purpose devices were controlled by this state of the art unit.

        "description": "This computer is the same as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=324\">Matsushita JR-200U<\/a>.\nTwo years in the making, the Panasonic JR-200 computer was officially announced in January of 1983, with additional launch dates provided for the computer and peripherals. The JR-200u received early and strong support from two software publishing companies; Data-Most and Walt Disney Telecommunications. \nHaving the support of both of these companies, especially Data-Most, was crucial in Panasonic's strategy to successfully market this computer, as well as it's plans to have 30 software titles available by the official launch in the spring of 1983. Additionally, Panasonic planned for an additional 24 titles to become available by mid-summer of 1983 by consulting with other software developers.\nFrom the start, the Panasonic JR-200u was never meant to be a cartridge based machine. Panasonic had other plans for a cartridge based system which never materialized. Initially, software was to be developed first on cassette tapes, and later floppy disks.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=553\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "MZ-40K was an ancestor of the Sharp MZ computers series. It was a single-board microcomputer in a plastic covered box. Sharp called it \"Dr. Microcomputer (MAIKON HAKASE)\". It was designed as a consumer electrical appliance and sold as a toy or a training tool for the first microcomputers fans.\nThe MZ-40K had a built-in speaker and could play music automatically or become an organ, using the monitor keys. Software was included into the 4-bit CPU ROM and users could run several basic applications without any programming skill.\nMZ-40K wasn't a marketing success, mainly because it was designed only for beginners without expansions capabilities, while the major competitor, NEC TK-80, offered a full range of software and hardware expansions.\n<b>Karl Heinz Mau<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sharpmz.org\">sharpmz.org<\/a>) reports us:\n<font color=\"#666666\">it uses an AC Adaptor 10.5 Volt (AC !!). Not DC, because the clock functions uses the 50 Hz of the power to generate the clocking (seconds by a blinking LED-point, minutes, hours).\nThe complete computer was sold as a kit! The operating manual contains about\n25 pages (of 68) to build the MZ-40K.\n \nThere are two options for the MZ-40K which could be bought seperately.\nOption 1 is named Sensor. It is a REED or microswitch used to play \nself-programmed melodies continuosly or one to 15times. It can be\nused too for counting events when the switch is pressed. The number of\nevents will be displayed with the LEDs.\nOption 2 is an organ keyboard kit to play your melodies. It is connected by a 12 wires cable.\nThere are 7 global and choosable functions of the MZ-40K:\n1 Clock\n2 Timer ( plays a melody\/tone at a specified time )\n3 Organ by its keyboard\n4 Playing melodies (3 octaves, 127 notes)\n5 Telephone costs. To this you have to set the MZ-40K into this mode\nby using some keyboard functions. You press RUN at the beginning of your\ncall and STOP at the end. MZ-40K will show the costs... from 1\ngerman penny up to 15 stepped by 1 penny. May be, this can be used for\nother purposes too?\n6 Games (like cube or cube games, roulette, car race, hunting deer, etc.)\n7 the 6 sensors make several applications possible...\nKey functions:\nADR to set the address in RAM to be read\/write\nREAD to read and display at the LEDs the hexadecimal contents of a RAM\naddress\nWRITE to write the hexadecimal data typed in by the keyboard into the RAM\nCLEAR to delete\/correct wrong data typed in\nRUN execute a program (1 to 7, see above)\nSTOP to stop the execution\n0 - F hex keyboard or to play the musical note shown on the key (e.g. Mi,\nFa, Fa# etc.)\nThanks to <b>Ohishi Nuboaki<\/b> and his Sharp MZ dedicated <a href=\"http:\/\/cwaweb.bai.ne.jp\/~ohishi\/museum\/mz40k_e.htm\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> and <b>Karl Heinz Mau<\/b> for informations and pictures.<\/font>",

It was however a nice designed system with its 8 function keys mounted directly onto the monitor (like with some Hewlett-Packard systems). The idea was interesting, because the function of each key was dynamicaly displayed right above it, but it becomes tiring to have to lift an arm to reach these keys...\nThe AXEL-20 can display 640 x 416 pixels with 8 different level of brightness. The system has it own character set (128 ASCII characters, upper and lower case). The user character generator is only optional. In fact many features are optional; real-time clock, disk-drive, expansion bus, V24 card, modem, graphic card...\nThe AXEL-20 is not IBM PC compatible at all. It can only read IBM disks with a special software tool.\nThe OS and languages available were MS-DOS, CP\/M, Fortran, Basic, Pascal and Cobol. Software amng others: Dbase II, Multipla, Wordstar.\nThe AX-20 was marketed as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=959\">MAX-20<\/a>, under the Matra brand (\"M\" for Matra ?).\nTwo years later, an enhanced model was marketed: the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=82\">AX-25<\/a>.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/linewid.free.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bertrand Poupeau<\/a> for the picture<\/font>",

        "description": "Microwriter was not really a computer, but a very original pocket word processing system, designed in 1980 by Endfield Cie in the USA and later manufactured in the UK. It used a keyboard with only 6 keys which made it possible to keyboard all the alphabet letters, numerals and punctuation marks. The typing method used the letters shape likeness and only one hand was necessary to type text. It only required a few hours to get used to keyboard and then typing speed could be very fast.\nThe internal design of MicroWriter was similar to a pocket calculator with low power components and rechargeable batteries ensuring a 30 hours autonomy. The 14 character LCD display allowed horizontal text scrolling. Several editing controls made it possible to correct, remove, add and move text.\nThe integral word processing software could connect directly to a printer and did formatting. It also allowed to upload\/download documents to a computer via that same serial port.\nMicrowriter could be also connected to a video monitor via an external unit, and an acoustic modem. The text could be recorded as well on tape.\nThe original concept of Microwriter did not meet much success, and distribution stopped in 1985, though the keyboard was subsequently used on the AgendA (1988-93) and still available  for PC &amp; Palm as the CyKey from Bellaire Electronics.\n_______________________",

        "description": "The CompuColor II, also called the \"Renaissance Machine\", is said to be the first home-computer available with a colour display. ISC (Intelligent Systems Corp), who was a large color computer manufacturer, conceived the CompuColor II built into a RCA color TV chassis (sans tuner assembly). The main problem of the system was that the machine had *no* RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) shielding what-so-ever and the FCC was soon on their butts. They planned to redesign the system but then prefered to stop production...\nThe first Compucolor system (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=565\">model 8001<\/a>) was in fact an 8080 based terminal (model 8001) and was later followed by the CompuColor II (model 8051), with BASIC and a floppy interface. It seems like the system was sold by ISC, Compucolor and Intecolor; but in which order ? Any idea someone ?\nDifferent models with different keyboards were available. The one pictured here is the Deluxe model with a full implemented keyboard. There were models with 16, 32 or 48 kb RAM. Later models seemed to have a built-in 300 baud modem. Apparently, you could not format the 5.25\" disks yourself, surely because Intecolor wanted to make money by selling these preformated disks... But many users ended up by writing their own formating programs.\nThe system was very vulnerable to certain hardware tinkering. Tampering with the addresses that accessed the hardware registers could wipe out all the RAM (it did something fatal to the refresh logic). It used an Intel CRT controller for screen processing. Altering the number of scanlines to too high a value could kill the CRT.\nThe ROM contained a ripped-off version of Microsoft BASIC and a simplistic file system. Microsoft found out about them, and forced ISC to become a Microsoft distributor. They also collected royalties on all machines sold up to that time.\nThe disk drive was originally designed to use an 8-track tape cartridge for storage (yes, you read that right!). When that proved to unreliable, they switched to a 5.25 inch disk drive. They didn't change the file system, which still thought it was a tape drive. When you deleted a file, it re-packed all remaining files back to the front of the disk. Used the 8K of screen RAM for a buffer to do it, which led to some psychedelic I\/O.\nSome games were available, such as the famous Star-Trek, Othello, Chess, Black Jack, Tic Tac Toe, etc.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/~compcloset\/\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Closet Collection<\/a> for the picture.\nThanks to <b>Woodside<\/b> for some information.<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=560\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The POLY 88 was a S-100 bus based computer sold in kit or assembled versions. The small case could receive the 8080 CPU board and three additional S-100 cards. Daughter boards were provided by Polymorphic to expand system capacities: video, keyboard, serial and cassette interfaces.\nThe system was also compatible with Altair peripherals. Originally, the computer was sold with the name \"Micro-Altair\", but MITS (the Altair manufacturer) required to change it quickly. So the company name became Polymorphic and its first computer, the POLY 88.\nIn 1976, five versions were proposed: \n<b>System 1<\/b> Kit version including 512 bytes RAM, 1 Kb.

The system could be expanded with additional ROM and RAM. Programs were written with the integrated ROM Basic language which used only one PLOT instruction with numerous parameters to manage graphic displays. A  special  hardware feature called 'Vector Graphics' allowed the computer to draw straight lines. An optional light pen could be used too with the PLOT instruction.\nThe only difference between the 8001 and the 8051 versions seems to be in the screen size which is of 19 inches in the 8051 model.\nThis first version of the Compucolor was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=560\">Compucolor II<\/a>, sold by Intelligent Systems Corp.",

Before manufacturing computers, SWTPC sold home audio kits and a kind of computer terminal called \"Television Typewriter\".\nThe SWPTC 6800 was introduced in 1975. The first system included a case with power supply housing a SS-50 and SS-30 bus based motherboard, a 6800 CPU card, a 2 KB. static RAM card and a serial I\/O card. User had to buy an additional terminal to enter information, and thus a ROM monitor allowed him to examine and modify memory, load\/save programs on tape or boot from a floppy disc unit.\nEvery original card was built around the Motorola family chips which made the SWTPC 6800 an inexpensive system for the time. The system was sold in a 2 KB kit version ($395) or 4 KB, 8 KB or 40 KB assembled versions. It came with a complete documentation including the 6800 programming manual and a program examples book.\nThe ROM and RAM was organized as follow: The MikBug chip (instant-on ROM BIOS) was 1024 bytes, of which 512 bytes were useable; MikBug let you write programs immediately in hex. The CPU board had a 2K bit RAM chip on it organized as 256 Bytes. The memory board included with the kit was 4K but it came with only 2K of RAM chips, 16 X 1024 bit. \n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Michael Holley's SWTPC 6800\/6809 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swtpc.com\/mholley\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation collection<\/a> for some informations and pictures.<\/font>\n<b>Dave O'Neil<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Loved seeing the old 6800 on your site. I am a high school physics teacher (I just retired). I built one in early '76 and two of my students went on to build one, too!  At least 5 were immediately guided into computers when they saw it that year. I sent a passle of my BASIC physics programs to Wayne Green at Microcomputing and he published them in the June '80 issue of Microcomputing, p. 138.\nThere were a few newsletters printed and sent out free with all sorts of great stuff to input. Everyone grabbed the hex-binary one for finding bad memory chips. There soon was an assembler that everyone started writing programs with. Then a co-resident assembler\/desembler. When Uiterwyck's 4K BASIC came out everyone, went to 8K or 12K. When his 8K came out, we went from 8K to 12K or 16K. I tell people that if IBM had gone Motorola instead of Intel, he'd be the richest man, now.<\/font>\n<b>Chip Gill<\/b> replies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I am one of Dave O'Neil's students that also built this machine. Loved using it through 2 years of high school and 4 years of college. My college senior project was a 32K byte memory card for this system which replaced the 4 cards that were 4K each. Thank you very much Mr O'Neil for the inspiration and understanding of computers that I've enjoyed for over 30 years now.<\/font>",

        "description": "When the C4P was launched, Ohio Scientific said that it was a giant step in the world of the home computers. It was twice as fast as an Apple ll or Commodore Pet and more than three times as fast as a Tandy TRS 80.\nHowever, despite its technological lead, the C4P and other Ohio Scientific computers always suffered of a lack in efficient software and attractive handbooks. For this reason, very few third companies built cards and peripherals for the Challenger series. So, the C4P didn't withstand to the competition of  the Apple II and II+ version which appeared 4 months later.\nHowever, Ohio Scientific sold it until 1981 as a business oriented system.\nIn March 1981, OSI was sold to 'M\/A-Com' company, but the name did continue  until at least 1985. Some OSI based systems were also sold under the name OSITRON.\nIn 1979, two versions were sold:\nThe <b>C4P<\/b> basic version ($698) with:\n- 8KB Basic ROM\n- 8KB of static RAM expandable to 32KB\n- Audio tape interface.\nThe <b>C4P MF<\/b> ($1695) with all the features of the C4P plus:\n- 24KB RAM expandable to 48KB\n- 5\" floppy-disc drive unit\n- Real time clock\n- Interfaces for Home Security System, parallel printer, modem\n- Bus connector.\n<b>Brett Molotsky<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The Challenger 4P was also sold for a VERY brief time by JCPenney stores in a consumer-friendly version. It had an all-plastic case that was a bit more sleek and that looked much like an Apple II case. That's where we bought ours, along with a black and white TV and a cassette tape player.<\/font>\n<b>David Pelleg<\/b> recalls:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The C4P was my first computer.  It was great except it had ONE MAJOR DESIGN FLAW which anyone who ever used it would know quite well.  That was the placement of the reset key directly adjacent to the (very small) enter key.  One little touch of reset and EVERYTHING you had been working on was wiped out instantly.  That is why I'm so paranoid about constantly saving files even today (where it takes ctrl-alt-delete plus \"Are you sure you would like to restart?\").<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=572\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Executive is the successor of the Osborne 1, from which it keeps the good points and correct its flaws. More memory, bigger screen, more powerful software and... higher price.\nWhen closed, the Executive looks like a sewing machine! Once opened, the detachable keyboard is connected to the main unit through a quite short coiled cord. The keyboard can be tilted for a better typing. It has a separated numeric keypad and 4 cursor keys. The layout of these keys is not very convenient. There is \"left\" &amp; \"up\" on one row, and \"down\" &amp; \"right\" on the other...\nThe front panel of the Executive is divided in four parts. In the center, one can find the built-in amber monitor (13 x 10 cm) bigger than the Osborne 1 one. On the right hand side, there is the fan grid, the Executive logo and the on\/off button. The two 5.25\" half-height disk drives, are mounted horizontaly just above an empty disk storage space. Different connectors are placed at the bottom of the front panel: two RS232c\/serial (for printers and modem), one Centronics and the keyboard connector. Next to them are brightness and contrast control knobs, as well as a reset button.\nAt the back of the system is the handle to carry the system once it is closed. Under this handle is the fan trap door, which you have to open before starting to work. The Executive has of course its own power supply unit, but what is more uncommon, is that it can accept 110v or 220v, the system will convert both. This was useful for people traveling a lot.\nThe built-in monitor was the main flaw of the Osborne 1. This tiny screen was displaying 52 of 132 virtual columns (this was done by scrolling), resulting in 2 mm high characters! The Executive has a wider screen which can really display 80 columns, though some critics said it was still too small. The characters can be displayed in normal mode, half intensity, inverse or blink. Two character sets are available, and independant windows can be defined.\nThe Executive was delivered with a binder containing 14 disks! There was CP\/M+, Wordstar 3.3, Mailmerge, Supercalc 1.12, Pearl (file manager), Microsoft Basic 5.22, CBasic 2 and several tools. The Executive can also read disks from many other systems: Osborne 1, IBM PC under CP\/M 86, DEC VT 180, Xerox 820, Cromenco Minidisk and UCSD p. It can also emulate several terminal types: VT 100, ADM, Hazeltine, HP... and know several communication protocols: 3270, 2780, 3780 and X25.\nThough most reviews said it had 128 KB, the Executive is equiped with 124 KB from which only 60 KB are left free for the user. The missing 4K was because of the bank switching it couldn't switch the whole 64K only 60K could be switched the 4K had to remain common. The memory can however be expanded to 384 KB.",

        "description": "InterSystems was the computers brand name of the Ithaca company which previously manufactured various cards for other mainframe makers.\nThe DPS-1 is based on the S-100 bus. It seems to be a copy of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=62\">Altair 8800<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=542\">Cromemco Z-1<\/a> systems. The case had a 20-card capacity and can support 8 and 16 bit processors. \nWith a 16-bit Zilog Z8000 processor, the system could take up to 256 KB of RAM and run the Unix operating system, as well as the more usual CP\/M.\nIt was the last computer proposing a front panel with switches and data\/addresses LED.\n___________\n<b>Mark Mullin<\/b> specifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere were actually two boxes as I recall, one holding the computer and the other holding great big nasty heavy quantum hard disks (20Mb each) - you could actually have more than one drive. The OS it ran was Coherent, a Unix 7 clone from Mark Williams in Chicago.\nIt was one of the first machines you could get and reliably and affordably run your own UNIX server -  one thing that I do recall was that they'd built their own memory management unit on a S-100 card that attached to the cpu over an additional top bus -  the card used static high speed ram to hold the segmentation mapping data, and the chips themselves had a nasty habit of walking out of their sockets every month or so -  when the system started crashing a lot more than normal, you pulled out the mmu card and reseated all of the chips.<\/font>\n<b>Steven Sorensen<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThey made 2 styles of cases...one with a front panel, and one without. Later they came out with a cache-bios for their version of CPM, it became a real hot rod. Motherboards were by Godbout I believe. Early CPU boards were a little flakey at 4 MHz, but later cpu boards were great! I replaced the crystal section on the CPU board with a 6 MHz oscillator and Z80b CPU.<\/font>",

        "description": "This strange hybrid computer came in two parts: a videogame console and a computer. The game system, called the APF MP-1000, was released in 1978. It had two controlers, each with a joystick and a numeric keypad. It came with a built-in game called \"Rocket Patrol\".\nThe computer console, the \"Imagination Machine\" was sold as an add-on for the MP-1000. You could also buy both at the same time (most people did). The computer has a 53-key standard typewriter keyboard, a built-in stereo cassette deck (1500 baud), a built-in sound-speaker and an internal operating system and BASIC language interpreter. The APF BASIC, delivered on cartridge, was quite poor. You had to use a lot of POKEs and CALLs to play with graphics. For example, to clear the screen, the command was CALL 17046.\nThe video game system nestled on top of the keyboard module. This computer add-on concept would later be used by several game system manufacturers like Coleco with their <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=755\">Colecovision<\/a> game system connected to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=57\">Adam Computer<\/a>, or <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Intellivision<\/a> and their ECS module (and keyboard component).\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=584\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "In the very late 1960's, 2 professors at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio came up with the idea of a high density integrated circuit which would be\nprogrammable. Its purpose would be to a programmable\/adaptable physical\ninterface. They took this circuit design to various IC manufacturers and were\nturned down by all of the existing IC manufacturers. The reason? The chip was\ntoo specialized and would never have enough widespread applicability to be\nfinancially worth developing. \nHaving failed to convince any IC manufacturers, but still believing in the concept these 2 professors pressed on and went looking for manufacturers who would have an application for the new chip. They found such a firm in <b>Computer Terminal Corporation<\/b> (CTC), which made a variety of lower cost computer terminals which were compatible with the various computer companies. CTC was interested in the chip because it presented a way to make one terminal that could be programmed to behave like and handle the protocols of a variety of different computer manufacturers. [<font color=\"#666666\">This was the days of Snow White (IBM) and the seven dwarfs: Sperry, Burroughs, Honeywell, GE, Control Data Corporation....<\/font>]  CTC agreed to pay two different chip makers to produce the chip. Both chip makers decided to use a new technology, called PMOS, to produce the chip. CTC agreed to the use of the new technology, but was concerned about speed to market, so they set a time limit on the chip delivery.  Skip ahead a year or so.\nBoth chip makers have encountered new technology problems with PMOS and have failed to meet the CTC deadline.  So the contracts are canceled and CTC builds the chip via discrete TTL logic and puts it into a programmable desktop terminal\ncalled the Datapoint 2200.\nOne of the chip makers, Texas Instruments, shelves the project. The other chip\nmaker determines that they are approximately 85% complete on the project and\nthat while the project will never break even, it will cost less to finish the\nchip, put it on the market and recover some of the costs. They do this and\nabout a year later, a bell goes off in the financial department. The chip,\ncalled an Intel 8008, has broken even and is now making a profit. So the chip\nmanufacturer, Intel, goes on a field trip to visit customers who are buying the\nchip, to find out what it is being used for. In so doing, the customers have\nlots of suggestions on ways to improve the chip, which Intel does and thus the\nIntel 8080 is born.\nIn the meantime, back at CTC, they have introduced the Datapoint 2200 to the\nmarket. It becomes an extremely successful product. So much so, that CTC\nchanges it's name to Datapoint Corporation. They go on to invent another new\ntechnology to connect all of their low cost computers together. It was called\na Local Area Network (LAN) and was the most popular LAN until around 1980.\nWhile the initial Datapoint 2200 did not have a microprocessor in it, it had\nthe programmable equivalent of an Intel 8008 and it funded the initial\ndevelopment of the first microprocessor. Thus it is the first microprocessor\nbased computer.\nThe Datapoint 2200 had a small built in CRT screen, keyboard and 2 cassette\ndecks. There was a run light and 2 other lights on the keyboard. When the\nmachine halted, you could not tell where in the program it had done so. So you\nput in the O\/S cassette and rebooted. You then did a memory dump and tried to\ndeduce what had went wrong. Primitive by today's standards, it was the first\ncomputer on a desktop.\nThere were also an optional disk drive using Shugart 8\" floppies, single-sided, single-density. It was the first commercial computer to include them! Languages included Databus and Datashare (\"COBOL-like\" business computer languages, interpreted to allow multiple 80 character by 24 row dumb CRTs to share tiny partitions of RAM memory in the main system unit), a Basic interpreter, and RPG II compiler.\nDatapoint is still in business, but is only a small fraction of their size in the mid 1970's\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Tom Meserole<\/b> for all this info. He started programming DataPoint 2200 systems in 1972 while in college!<\/font>\n<b>We are seeking information and pictures of all other Datapoint systems!<\/b>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=596\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

Customer could purchase just the option board or could buy the complete terminal\/computer package called the <b>VT-180<\/b>.\nThe VT-100 terminal was introduced by Digital in August 1978. It rapidly enjoyed great popularity and soon became the most widely imitated asynchronous terminal. Its control codes and escape sequences still form the basis of the <b>xterm<\/b> set and of the ANSI or IBM PC standards. VT100 compatibility is still provided by most terminal emulators. All terminals that came after the VT100 was able to emulate their ancestor, although they offered new features in addition to what the VT100 could do. \nThe VT-180, also called 'Robin', was thus basically a VT100 terminal with an extra board installed which includes a Z80 processor, 64 KB of RAM memory, a floppy disk controller and an extra serial port controller. The single sided floppy disk drives came in a dual case.

The screen had also some interesting high resolution features.\nDespite this innovative idea, the DMS-5000 was not a great commercial success. However, the rotating screen concept will be later adopted by several major computer manufacturers, like Rank Xerox.",

Televideo offered their solution under the name <b>TS-802<\/b>. \nThe TS-802 was a traditional Z80 and CP\/M based system. There were two versions: one equiped with double 5.25'' disk drives, and another with a 10 MB hard disk (TS-802H).

(Cupertino),  the Advanced Technology Centre (ATC), a research centre specialized in new technologies and  office automation equipment design. During ten years the centre designed Olivetti typewriters, calculators, photocopiers, etc.... In 1980, the first Olivetti computer took form in Cupertino, and the M-20 computer was launched in March 1982. More than 50,000 units are estimated to have been shipped in the first year.\n \nThe M20 was one of the very rare computers based on the Zilog Z8000, a 16 bits microprocessor  very close to its 8 bits big brother the Z80. Like most of the computers designed before the IBM PC era, the M20 offered technical choices which made it totally incompatible with the rest of the micro world.\nThe first proprietary M20 operating system, called PCOS (Professional Computer Operating System) was also very particular and didn't allowed files to be exchanged with other systems. Hopefully, MS-DOS V2.0, CP\/M-86 and CP\/M-80 would be later adapted to the specific M-20 hardware. Moreover, front of this compatibility problem, Olivetti developped a coprocessor board based on the 8086 chip, which offered M20 owners access to IBM PC software.\nThe M20 came with a 12'' monochrome or colour custom built monitor. The international version had a grey plastic case, the Italian version had a brown one.",

His company was first called \"Morrow's Microstuff\" and the cards were sold by mail order. Some time later, Morrow Designs began to design hard disks and computers.\n \nWith this computer, G. Morrow tried to build a single-board Z-80 CP\/M machine that looks like an <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a> but is one-third as expensive as it, and half the price of a comparable Apple system (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=72\">Apple III<\/a>).\nThe basic version included a serial video terminal and a 200 KB 5.25 floppy disk drive. However, the mainframe could be sold alone with one or two floppy disk drives. The Micro Decision also came with 5 MB, 10 MB or 40 MB Winchester hard drive installed. The MicroDecision line didn't have proper monitors or keyboards. The console shown here is actually a VT52-compatible terminal.\nHere are the diffent models marketed and their US price in 1983 :\n<b>Model MD1<\/b> : one SSSD disk drive (200 KB) = $1590\n<b>Model MD2<\/b> : two SSSD disk drives (400 KB total) + Personal PEARL DBMS = $1950\n<b>Model MD3<\/b> : two DSDD disk drives (768 KB total) + Personal PEARL DBMS + QUEST Bookkeeper = $2490\nThe Morrow MD-1 used the Pilot programming language for a Menu-Driven shell to make the computer more user friendly. Some of the later ones manufacturered also used CP\/M 3.0.\nLike many CP\/M computer manufacturers, Morrow Designs offered a complete software package with its system, including:\n- <b>CP\/M 2.2<\/b> operating system\n- <b>WordStar<\/b> word processing from Micropro\n- Microsoft <b>BASIC-80<\/b> programming language\n- NorthStar compatible <b>BAZIC<\/b> language from Micro Mike's Inc.\n- A spelling checker\n- An electronic spreadsheet.\n______________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Gary Clouse, David Griffith<\/font>",

        "description": "Exxon Computer Division, a branch of the Exxon Oil Company, sold this computer in the U.S.A and Europe.\nThis computer was built in 1982. The system is composed of CPU box, monitor, dual disk drives and a  keyboard. It was delivered withe software on 5.2 disks, manuals, training materials.\nThis office computer was primarily a word processor with calenders, ticklers and file sharing capabilities. It ran on the Z-80 chipset with a 64 KB architecture running a CPM like OS. In some regards it is a monument to the arrogance of Senior Exxon management who felt that they were so good at managing an oil company, that surely they could manage a successful computer company.\nExxon owned Zilog, the creators of the Z80, which they purchased in 1980. The Z80 based Exxon 510 was the first system to grow out of that purchase. It has been argued by some the if Exxon had not purchased Zilog, that Zilog left alone would have rivaled Intel today. Exxon Office Systems was based on the purchase of Vydec and Zilog with the machines being developed by Compucorp and the printers being built by Qume.\nUnfortunately, Exxon really mismanaged the companies and they sold off the business in 1985. \nThe <b>510<\/b> version was the basic 64 KB system.\nThe <b>520<\/b> version offered 128 KB of RAM expandable up to 256 KB.\nThe <b>530<\/b> version featured a 5 MB or 10 MB HDD.\n_____\nContributors:  David Gallaher",

It is one of the first models made at the factory in Timisoara, western Romania in the early 1980s. MicroTim stands for \"Micro\" and \"TIMisoara\". It was designed at Polytehnica University from Timisoara (former TUT - Technical University of Timisoara, former IPTVT - \"Traian Vuia\" Polytechnical Institute), but its large scale fabrication started and continued at the Fabrica de Memorii Timisoara (the Computer Memory Factory). \nWhen the ZX Spectrum appeared in the early 80's, three unlicenced Romanian clones were developped almost independently. These were developped in three main university centres from Timisoara, called initially microTim, and then TimS (from TIMisoara and Spectrum), Cluj-Napoca called Prae (which means \"beginning\" in latin) and Bucharest called aMIC (translated as \"aSMALL\"). These were developped using a combination of the \"black box\" principle and illegally obtained desings. The \"Black Box \" approach was widely developped and used in Eastern Block for developping electronic devices. The same principle was used in Eastern Germany to make the best PC in the east called \"Robotron\". Unformally, \"Black Box\" means replacing a chip or a groups of chips that I do not know (or do not have) with another group that has same input and output signals.\nThe Cluj group dissapeared quite quickly, but Timisoara and Bucharest continued making spectrum based computers until early 1990s. Timisoara choose to further integrate and extend the model (as Sinclar did). The main designer behind TimS is eng. Dumitru Panescu who reached quite a mastery skill in integrating spectrum designs. His last prototype of TimS (it was never produced) integrated all spectrum firmware into one computer including a CP\/M option. At start-up the user would select by pressing a key what does he or she wants to use. \nIt has an original &amp; small keyboard (40 keys) with statements and functions labeled next to the keys, like on the ZX Spectrum. The system is powered by an external power supply.",

Its modular concept made the system to grow easily and allowed the user to adapt it to each particular environment.\nThe mainframe was equipped with five I\/O interfaces allowing it to be connected to a variety of laboratory instruments. Three user-input devices was available: Two programmable sensitive keyboards and a standard PC-type keyboard. A high-resolution display could be supplemented by a 4-color plotter-printer.\nThe 9000 has been engineered with crowded lab benches in mind: The modules stack vertically to conserve space.\nThe unit used a specific real time and multitasking operating system custom designed by IBM, as well as standard programming languages: BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN.

        "description": "This system is a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=290\">MSX Turbo R<\/a>. It is one of the last MSX computer ever made. It is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=291\">MSX 2+ systems<\/a> and thus has many characteristics in common. New features include a new PCM sound chip which can sample sound up to 15 KHz and replay up to 22 kHz. There is an internal microphone for the PCM unit. There is also an additional CPU, the R800 wich is a 16-bit RISC processor. The user can select the CPU (Z80 or R800) by software.\nThe FS-A1 GT follows the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=775\">FS-A1 ST<\/a>, and so introduces some improvements over it. Due to some minor bugs discovered, the mainboard is a bit different (e.g. FM-PAC part is redesigned to decrease influence of the noise from computer's digital parts). The MSX-BASIC, version 4.1 instead of 4.0, has MIDI extensions. Indeed the FS-A1 GT has a MSX-MIDI interface built-in with MIDI in\/out connectors! The RAM size is of 512 KB, instead of 256 KB. The MSX-DOS is now version V2.31. There is a SVHS video port and the size of the SRAM is now 32 KB.\nMSX View, developed by ASCII &amp; HAL, is a Windows-style graphic interface. It is built-in ROM. The OS is delivered with programs such as Page Edit, PageView, Page Link, VShell, VTed, VPaint and VDraw) on 512kB ROM DISK (C: drive). There is no tape recorder port, so strictly speaking, it's not an MSX! \nPanasonic stopped the production of the Turbo R when they launched the 3DO game system in 1992. They failed with this system and never returned to MSX.\nLot of extensions, however, were produced by third-party companies to enhance the Turbo R, among them, an OPL4 Sound Card, a VGA card with lot of hardware sprites and IDE or SCSI interfaces.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Source : The Ultimate MSX FAQ<\/font>\n<b>David Heremans<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">There is a mixed mode where you can have +4096 colors\nsimultaneously with an extra 16 indexed colors so that still pictures in\nfull color can be displayed while the index palatte of 16 redefinable colors\ncan be used for all kind of effects.

This machine took the A500 approach to computing with the \"distinct\" Commodore case, but including the AGA chipset present in the A4000, 2 MB RAM, and the PCMCIA slot from the A600. \nAt the price of ?399 it sold like hot cakes and is seen as one of the best Amigas to date. It appears to have been rushed to launch for the Christmas period with manuals claiming to give you the opportunity to upgrade from 1mb to 2mb chip ram with FPU. It is, however, a darn fine machine that can be easily upgraded for most of your needs. \nAfter Escom bought the Amiga during 1995 it was relaunched to mass outrage. The machine still cost ?399, ?150 more than it had done a year previously and was not enhanced in any dramatic fashion. It was released in two versions- the Amiga Magic pack and the Amiga Surfer bundle. Unfortunately, the former was never released due to Escoms financial situation. The Escom Amigas were also struck by incompatibility problems due to a different disk drive being used, it was actually a PC high-density drive mechanism that had been altered to allow compatibility with the Amiga file system. Unfortunately, some games that hit the hardware directly would not run. A circuit upgrade was released free of charge that allowed users to fix the drive problem. \n<font color=\"#666666\">Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/amiga.emugaming.com\/\" target=\"-blank\">Amiga Interactive Guide<\/a>\n<\/font>",

It was primarily intended for the Romanian schools and universities. As the engineers could not use the Spectrum \/ Feranti gate-array chip, they replaced it by a whole of logical chips that carried out exactly the same tasks.\nThe plastic case and the keyboard were of poor manufacture quality. However, the machine looked solid and the motherboard printed circuit was same quality level as the Western productions of the time.",

The computer has 64 KB RAM and is a CP\/M operating system.\nThere are several models of MikroMikko 1. The one pictured here is a M6 model which has two 5.25\" 640 KB disc drives. But other models differ and can have one or two disk drives (360 KB or 640 KB), and even a built-in 5 MB hard disk (model M7).\nThe MikroMikko 1 features high resolution graphics (800x327). It is quite heavy, the keyboard weighting alone about 2 kilograms! It was a very robust built system that was very suitable for hard environments such as schools. The machine has a linear power transformer and no fan. Cooling is done by a giant heat sink on the back side of the machine. \nErgonomics has always played a great part in the MikroMikko series and this model has a keyboard with a built-in wrist support and a very slow screen that is very comfortable even though it has a 50Hz refresh rate.\n \nNokia later bought Ericsson's computer division. Later ICL bought the Nokia Data from Nokia that concentrated on its key competence. This machine is peculiar in that sense that it has the old Nokia logo reminding that the company was originally making car tires besides rubber boots and cables. Computer manufacturing has ceased now in plants which made this system...\nMikroMikko got several follow-ups: MikroMikko 2 had a very nice display with white background and 72Hz refresh rate. it was also the only real computer that was powered by an Intel 86186. While MM2 was partly MS-DOS compatible, MikroMikko3 was an ergonomic beauty that was fully pc-compatible.\n_______\n<font color=\"#666666\">Texts and pictures from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iki.fi\/oju\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">Mika Ojutkangas website<\/a>.

This version was also sold with the HC-90 name.\nThe second one featured a new 50 keys keyboard design (picture). Thanks to two small rectractable feet, the keyboard can be tilted.\nAlso, the motherboard was completely redrawn to take account of the new memory chips (only two 4464 memory chips was needed instead of 24 chips in the HC-85 version). No additional feature was added and the systems were always pure Sinclair Spectrum clones, but also CP\/M compatible machines if a disk extension was used.\nDespite the use of many components from Eastern Europe, one finds however several Japanese, American and even Brasilian chips.\nAn HC-91+ was also produced, it featured a daughter board with three interfaces: 5,25\" floppy disk drives, serial RS232 and local network. (See the Read More section for more details)\nproduction of HC-91 was stoped in 1992, when Ice-Felix lunched the HC-2000, which had same basic features as the hc-91 plus built-in floppy disc drive, and hardware upgrades.\nThe last HC model was a 386SX PC compatible with 1 MB ram, vga, buit-in 3.5 floppy, apox. same case as HC2000 and TV and monitor conectors.

The MPC's disk controller was integrated into the motherboard.\nAs IBM didn't well protect the PC hardware and BIOS software copyrights, this first clone will be followed by many others, desktops and portables version, manufactured in numerous countries by hundreds of independant companies, all over the world. \nThe Columbia company was sold in 1986 to a company based in Florida which kept the name and still exists. \n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Joe Cassara.<\/font>",

        "description": "This is the American version of the Spectrum. It has an additional 8K extension ROM, cartridge port, two joystick ports and AY-3-8912 sound chip with extra Sinclair BASIC commands to support these devices (STICK, SOUND). It was packaged in a hard plastic silver case with nonstandard plastic keys.\nThe TS2068 is Timex's re-engineered 48K Spectrum. It was released in Fall 1983 just before Timex Computer Corp folded in Spring 1984. A rogue arm of Timex in Portugal continued to sell TC2068s (same as TS2068) and TC2048s (an improved Spectrum) until 1989. They, of course, were only allowed to sell in non-Sinclair controlled marketplaces.\nTimex recognized that a 48K Spectrum would not continue being competitive in North America for long without changes being made. They developed two computers that were to be North America's debut of the Spectrum. One was called the TS2048 and the other the TS2068. The TS2048 was basically a 48K Spectrum w\/ Kempston joystick and the advanced video modes of the TS2068. The TS2068 was a completely different computer with the Spectrum as its roots. Timex decided to only sell the TS2068. When sales over Christmas 1983 were disappointing, they pulled the plug. Timex of Portugal, no doubt encouraged by the Spectrum's popularity in Europe, continued to sell the TS2068 and offered the TS2048 as the TC2068 and TC2048 in parts of Europe, notably Portugal and Poland. When Timex pulled the plug, they dumped all their surplus TS2068s in Argentina.\nAs for Spectrum compatibilty: The tape I\/O is the same so you can load Spectrum tape files.  Spectrum BASIC is a subset of the TS2068's BASIC, so you can run Spectrum BASIC programs.  The TS2068's ROM is different, though, so you can't run Spectrum m\/c that makes use of the ROM. Without the aid of a Spectrum emulator, you can run about 7% of the Spectrum's commercially available software.\nThe Spectrum emulator is really a Spectrum ROM on cartridge (there are other forms) that is bankswitched into the lower 0-16K region. The top 48K region is filled with RAM. To the software this looks exactly the same as a 48K Spectrum. There are a few hardware reasons for incompatibilities but using an emulator, you can reach 97% compatibility.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n________\nText taken from Sinclair Computer Hardware Factsheet.\nThanks Bob Johnson.<\/font>",

It used a Motorola MC68030 and a Motorola DSP 56K.\nThe \"Sparrow Card\" used a 16 MHz 68030, a 16 MHz 68882 (arithmetic coprocessor) and a 32 MHz DSP 56K with 24 KB of static RAM.\nLater, when Atari made the first fully functionnal computer from this prototype board, they planned to name it \"FX-1\", they eventually name it \"Falcon\".\nThe Atari FX-1, or \"Sparrow\", is also a prototype machine. Actually, it is almost a Falcon030. It has all its features except its true color mode (not fully implemented in the FX-1) and the PCM sound channels (12 bit instead of 16 in the Falcon).\nThese computers used the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=164\">Atari Mega STe<\/a> TOS (2.06) slightly modified to cope with the new graphic modes. This TOS version had the number 2.07 and was replaced in the last Sparrow models with the TOS 4.0 (The Falcon used TOS 4.01 in the earlier models, then the 4.04 and finally the 4.92 (never released)).\nAtari produced less than 100 of these machines. They were built with sample spare parts and were used by developpers to write software for the future Atari Falcon.\n<b>Curl Vendel<\/b> says :\n<font color=\"#666666\">Originally, the Sparrow\/FX-1 had a better graphics processor, but it was incompatible with most software.

        "description": "The Timex-Sinclair 1500 is basicaly a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">Sinclair ZX-81<\/a> in a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">ZX Spectrum<\/a> case with 16 KB RAM.\nTimex marketed the Sinclair computers on the North American market. The ZX-81 was sold as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=477\">TS-1000<\/a> (with 2 KB RAM instead of 1 KB of the original model) and the ZX Spectrum as the forth-coming TS-2000 (which remained a prototype). As the sales of the TS-1000 were dangerously falling, Timex produced a mix between the ZX-81 and the ZX Spectrum: the TS-1500. The goal was to correct the weaknesses of the TS-1000: too small memory and awfull keyboard.\nIt's in fact just a ZX-81 with the 16 KB RAM expansion built inside a Spectrum style case. But the original black case turned silver for the TS-1500. To prove that it is exactly the Spectrum case re-used here, there is still the speaker grid underneath the system, whereas the TS-1500 has no sound feature! However there are minor cosmetic changes: the \"sinclair\" encarved logo on top of the case is replaced by a fake grid... In fact, this plastic case was the TS-2000 one (which was never produced), reused here for the TS-1500.\nThe chicklet keyboard is also an improvement (really?) over the flat membrane keyboard of the ZX-81. The keys layout is exactly the same as the ZX Spectrum. You can even use keyboard membranes of the Spectrum 48KB to replace the existing one if it breaks. Apart from that it remains a TS-1000. The connectors are the same (RF TV ouput, tape recorder, expansion bus) and the Basic is still the Sinclair Basic. A 16k RAM expansion (the same as the one sold for the TS-1000) can be used to reach 32 KB RAM.\nHowever, the TS 1500 had a number of changes that made it different than just a TS 1000 \/ ZX-81 with 16k:\n1. The ROM was updated to check for 16 KB memory and correct faults in the TS 1000 version (which corrected faults in the ZX81 version).\n2. You could only add a 16 KB RAM pack (1016). To use any larger 3rd party RAM pack from the TS1000\/ZX81 family you need to modify the motherboard.\n3. Circuitry was added to allow you to choose which channel to display, 2 or 3, when you turned on the system by holding down the \"3\" key on the keyboard.\n4. The motherboard is a complete redesign with 16 KB onboard and the ULA (Undefined Logic Array) was surface mounted and not socketed.\nDespite its funky look, the TS-1500 did not sell well either. In 1983, who wanted to buy a ZX-81 disguised whereas you could offer yourself a splendid <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a> for a few more bucks!\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributed to this page : Bill Hicks<\/font>",

Very handy when doing basic programming. The only drawback is that the macro-key is the same key that changes from uppercase to lowercase and is also used when performing a reset. This results in constantly changing to lowercase when not wanting to. There are also two keys to make your own macros for the numeric keys.\nThe drive controller and a Z80 CPU (for CP\/M compatibility) are not optional but built in on the motherboard. When you boot the system, it says \"DISK ON\" instead of \"APPLE ][\".",

        "description": "In 1987 Canon USA Inc. released a new computer named the Canon Cat. This computer was targeted at low-level clerical workers such as secretaries. After six months on the market and with 20,000 units sold, Canon discontinued the Cat. \nThe Cat featured an innovative text based user interface that did not rely upon a mouse, icons, or graphics. The key person behind the Cat was Jef Raskin, an eclectic gadgeteer, who began the design of the Cat during his work on the first Macintosh project at Apple Computer in 1979. \nThe Cat was a 17 pound desktop computer system containing a built in 9\" black-and-white bit-mapped monitor, a single 3.5-inch 256K floppy disk drive, and an IBM Selectric-style keyboard. It came with an extensive collection of applications stored in ROM. These applications supported word processing, spell checking, mail merging, calculator functions, communications, data retrieval, and programming in the FORTH or 68000 assembly languages. Also present in the ROM was a spelling dictionary based on the 90,000 word American Heritage Dictionary. System setup information and a small personal user dictionary were stored in 8K of battery backed up RAM. \nThe Cat's user interface made this computer unique. The user interface was based on a simple text editor in which all data was seen as a long stream of text broken into pages. Special keyboard keys allowed the user to invoke various functions. An extra key titled \"Use Front\" acted as a control key. You pressed Use Front and then a special key to activate a specific feature. For example, the L key was marked Disk, the J key was marked Print, and the N key was marked Explain (Cat's context sensitive help facility). Other commands existed to let you change the system's various parameters (Setup key) and reverse your last action (Undo key).\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: David Patterson (editor), John J.

        "description": "The <b>TO-7\/70<\/b> was presented alongside the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=12\">MO5<\/a>, in march 1984. While the MO-5 represents a small break into the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=11\">TO-7<\/a> philosophy, the TO-7\/70 follows and enhances the TO-7 features.\nThe case of the TO-7\/70 is almost the same as the TO-7 one : roughly triangular with sharp edges. The keyboard, though made of rubber keys, is an improvement over the flat membrane keyboard of the TO-7. The keyboard layout is AZERTY which is normal as the TO-7\/70 is a french system. Accentuated letters can directly be accessed by pressing the ACC key, followed by the desired key (6 for ?, 7 for ?, 8 for ?, 9 for ? and 0 for ?). There are also four arrow keys, INS to insert a space, EFF to delete the pointed character, STOP to pause a program, CNT to resume a program stoped and RAZ (remise ? z?ro) to clear the screen.\nThe light-pen introduced on the TO-7 has been improved on TO-7\/70. While its resolution was only 40x200 on the TO-7 (one eighth of the horizontal range), it can now access every point of the screen, that is to say 320 x 200 pixels. \nThe expansion possibilities of the TO-7\/70 are the same as the TO-7 : 3 expansion connectors for printers, disk-drives, game extension, etc. and 1 memory expansion slot. There is also still a tape-recorder intreface.\nThe main improvements over the TO-7 are :\n- better integration of the components on the main-board\n- a better keyboard (hmmmm, so they say)\n- more RAM (48 KB, instead of 22 KB)\n- a switch to lock the cartridge trap door, since it used to open randomly on the TO-7, rebooting the system and thus loosing all work in progress\n- more colours (16 instead of 8)\n- better light-pen precision\n- the infamous heat-sink at the back of the TO-7 has disapeared !\nThe TO-7 is upward compatible with the TO-7\/70, i.e. software developped for the TO-7 can be used by the TO-7\/70, but not the contrary... It also means that the MEMO7 cartridge format is still the same.\nAS for the MO-5, the TO-7\/70 was quite popular in schools, as Thomson was the main supplier of the French National Education for the \"Informatique Pour Tous\" Plan. TO-7\/70 (and MO5) were mainly used as terminals for the famous \"Nanor?seau\", an educational network, often piloted by a Logabax Persona 1600.\nA second model with better mechanical keyboard was released some months later, for christmas 1985 (see more pictures section). In fact this model was first sold as an exportation model along with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=838\">MO5E<\/a>. They were both presented at the \"Hannover Messe\" (Germany) in april 1985. That explains why some rumours talked about a TO-7\/70E model, but it was never called like this. It was exactly the same model sold later in France.\nThe TO-7\/70 was finally replaced by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=238\">TO-8 and TO-8D<\/a> in 1986.",

        "description": "After buying the Franco-American CIE <b>Friends Amis<\/b> (Amis means Friends in French) and their hand held computer project, Matsushita manufactured the computer and sold it under Panasonic (RL-Hxx series) and <b>Quasar<\/b> (HK-2600TE) brand names. About 70.000 Panasonic systems were sold.\nThe system was mainly conceived to run custom software developed by third companies. For this reason, it didn't included powerful built-in software or languages but featured  an universal expansion port able to manage several peripherals simultaneously, and three ROM chip compartments. Examples of available software are: Portawriter, Telecomputing 1-2-3, File Exchange, Portacalc, Portaflex (store management), Portabudget, Portabroker, Porta Bid, Portastock, Portalog, Portasales, Portaservice, Portaaudit, etc.\nThe system featured SNAP, an interpreted programming language, close to Forth and not really easy to learn. Hopefully, a light version of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter ROM could be added. \nThe HHC (for \"Hand Held Computer\") had great success in USA, mainly in insurance companies thanks to a built-in custom insurance calculation application dedicated to claim adjusters and travelling salesmen who could make any insurance quotation and print it, anywhere, anytime. Few systems were sold in other countries.\nThe picture shows a system with a Printer\/Cassette interface attached. User had to buy it to save programs files on tape! The printer used a small roll of thermal paper of 75 mm wide. It printed 16 chars. per line at a speed of 24 chars.\/second.\nGraphic possibilities were available as an option, as well as a TV video interafce which enabled the HHC to be connected to a TV through a scart connector. The HHC could then display 32 x 16 characters in text mode (character matrix 5 x 7), or 128 x 64 with 8 colors in semi-graphic mode or 128 x 128 with 4 colors in graphic mode.",

The serial \/ parallel board experienced some compatibility flaws as printers connected to them weren't automaticaly recognized by Apple II management software.\nFranklin machines ran FDOS - Franklin DOS, which was compatible with DOS 3 from Apple, but had a lot of cool features such as built-in RAM disk, disk caching, loadable device drivers, shortened commands, support for hard drives, etc.\nIn september 1983, Franklin lost a trial against Apple for counterfeiting\nROM software from the Apple II and II+.

At this time, PC\/Intel based systems used a 8 bit-bus processor running twice slower, and a primitive operating system. So why this Sage system didn't become the standard of the future? \nIn addition to the P-System delivered with the system, several companies in the world wrote various operating systems (CP\/M, Posix, PDos, Tripos, Pluto...) and languages (Fortran, Lisp, Pascal...) for the Sage IV. \nAlthough Sage systems were the fastest personal systems of their days, and were intensively used by scientists and engineers for more than ten years, they are now totally forgotten, and so are all their powerful related OS's and software.",

        "description": "The Concept system was intended to be an individual diskless workstation operating within a Local Area Network (LAN). Each user could use the ressources of the computer and share both data and peripheral devices, including mass storage devices. The network connected computers offered some attractive cost advantages and allowed several people to work simultaneously on the same task.\n  \nUsers' data were shared through the Corvus <b>OmniNet<\/b> networking system which was the core product of Corvus Company and the first affordable and reliable network system for small computers. OmniNet could handle up to 63 workstations with a maximum cable length of 1200 metres.  The theoretical speed was at 1 MB per second. The Omninet interface was designed by Corvus, used a 6502 processor and NEC custom chips. An Omninet card was available during two years for IBM-PC, Apple II and S-100 BUS systems.As the Concept featured four <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> compatible slots, the lan card was inserted in one of them in the first systems, then Omninet was on the motherboard of the Corvus. \n \nThe graphic bitmap display could be rotated and switch from portrait mode for the word processor to landscape mode for the spreadsheet. Software and hardware handled the change smoothly! The user could choose between several supplied type fonts or\/and create his own caracter sets. Like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=265\">Apple Lisa<\/a>, the display could be divided into independant windows, each with its own attributes. However, no mouse was used\nThe Concept ran CCOS, its own operating system (Corvus Concept Operating System), or P-System, the Java-like O.S. of the early 80'. A word processor (EdWord) and a spreadsheet (Logicalc) were available. They were specially adapted to the graphic features specific to the Concept. Several developpement tools could also be used: PASCAL and FORTRAN-77 compilers, 68000 assembler and a CP\/M emulator.\nCorvus manufactured several hard-disk drives, from 6 MB to 40 MB, and a stange mirror unit that allowed the user to backup a drive to a real video recorder using real video tapes - there was even a Panasonic (?) video recorder that the system knew how to drive remotely so it managed and recorded tapes, all by itself - pretty magic to watch in those days!! It could store up to 200 MB at the speed of 600 KB per minute. There were at least two versions of Corvus Bank Tape, the CBT-100 and the CBT-200 certified 100 and 200 Megabyte.\nA second backup unit called <b>The Bank<\/b> also used video type tape, but it was built into a special (roughly square) cartridge that popped out of the top and held the tape in a continuos loop so there was no rewinding or stuff to do.\nLike many other original computers, the Concept has sunk into oblivion in 1984, mainly due to the IBM-PC advent.",

        "description": "The Acorn Cambridge Workstation was the only model from the announced, marketed but unreleased ABC (Acorn Business Computer) line, first claimed to be available in October 1984. The ABCs were a range of machines using an integrated monitor, disk drive, PSU and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">BBC B+<\/a> 64K motherboard with slight modifications, originally featuring CPUs from straight 6502 terminals to an 80286 based system.\nDifferences between the released Cambridge Workstation and the 32016 co-processor and ABC models were minor. Instead of the ABC 200 series' 512K or 1024K RAM, the Cambridge had 4096K, and a 20 MB HD instead of 10 MB. The Tube-connected board is very different from the 32016 co-processor, which also featured 1024K RAM. Internally the I\/O board (a modified BBC B+) differed from a regular B+ in that the Econet system was fitted, the RF modulator was omitted, as was the sideways RAM expansion header and the header for the PHROM socket on the B's keyboard. The underside connections were upright instead of flat, but fully-featured. \nConnected to the 1MHz bus internally were a mouse board (optional) with 2 connectors, one leading to a space for a further option (such as an internal modem), one leading to the SCSI controller which appears to be electronically identical to the internal modem-slot SCSI of the BBC Master Domesday machine. The SCSI controller was connected to an Adaptec MFM controller and a 20 MB hard disk. \nThe Tube connector wasn?t replicated externally, and linked to the 32016. A switch on the machine's keyboard allowed the Cambridge to run as a BBC B+ (the ROM identifies itself as a Cambridge Workstation with ADFS, then boots into BASIC without announcing it - OS is 2.10, same as a B+). Switching modes is destructive, rebooting the machine. As the BBC B+ handles all I\/O, it is a slight bottleneck to the 32016, however for the time it was still an impressively fast computer. \nThe internal construction is very interesting. The monitor case has overcenter catches and lifts off (with some delicacy), revealing the display and not much else. Each side has a board carrier, one containing the 32016 and RAM, the other containing 1MHz bus devices. Once these are detached, 4 more catches release the monitor and it hinges up and forward, revealing the BBC B+ \"I\/O board\". There are sockets for Speech (I have installed this option) and sideways ROMs - in theory any expansion for a B+ would work provided there is clearance. There is a volume control, explaining the connectors that are unused on the B+, and the keyboard's 25 pin (not fully populated) D-sub connector has a wire stripped off and directed to the co-processor board, but is otherwise electronically identical to a BBC keyboard!\n  \nThe Cambridge was a dead-end for Acorn. Olivetti killed the project when they took over, though at least one exists with an ARM1 co-processor installed (perhaps user-added, but rumoured to be a real Acorn development machine). It's clearly an unfinished machine, and PANOS was yet another dead end, utilised seemingly because the intended OS - Xenix - required an MMU which the 32016 family lacked. It wasn't the only deviation from the widely-held belief that Acorn ignored CPUs other than the 6502 until the Archimedes range was launched, as the Acorn Communicator (another dead end, the case of which would later become the Master Compact) used the 65C815 16-bit CPU and the Master 512 used the 80186. Had Acorn released the ABC range it would have been too late to secure the marketplace for the apparent cost of constructing them, and the Cambridge, without any real OS or applications support, survived as a machine purely for academic use - offering remarkable computing power for the era and allowing students to compile their programs without having to time-share on a mainframe. The potential would have been enormous had it been marketed with a GUI at a time when the Macintosh could only muster 128 or 512K with no colour support...\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n_________\nThanks A LOT to Richard Kilpatrick for all this info and pictures! <a href=\"mailto:richard@dmc12.demon.co.uk\">Contact him<\/a> if you are a user of this system, or have manuals, OS disks, software or anything related to it.<\/font>",

        "description": "A classic german pong system which uses the GI AY-3-8500 chip, thus playing the 4 basic pong games. No shooting games here... Something rare for that time, the two tiny controllers are not hardwired to the system. This means that when one of them died, it wasn't necessary to change the whole system.\nThe shape of the case is weird. It looks like a case conceived for a small computer. Indeed there's enough room for a small keyboard instead of the actual panel control, and the bulk at the back could have contained a mother board or any other hardware...\nActually, this bulk is used to store the controllers when the system is not used, and there's also the cells compartment.\nWhen the system is opened, one can observe that under the control panel, several holes in the plastic case are not used by the system and are hidden by the black plastic film.

        "description": "The Telstar Arcade is maybe one of the most interesting systems made by Coleco, and also the most advanced PONG system released in America, although it played non-PONG games.\nMade in a triangular case, the system could play three types of games, each being played on one of the three sides of the case. Obviously, the first side allowed playing PONG games (TENNIS and the like), and the second side allowed playing target shooting games. Nothing very different from most other systems, except the gun storage.\nThe third face was the most interesting: it allowed playing car racing games. Very few systems offering that type of games were released at this time, and the games were only played using rotary controllers or some sort of joysticks. Best of Coleco's Telstar Arcade was the wheel and the gear box for the car racing games.\nSince several types of games could be played, the system used interchangeable cartridges. Telstar Arcade is therefore of the earliest systems to use cartridges containing a dedicated game chip. Each cartridge contains a chip made by MOS Technology: the MPS-7600. The four versions of this chip contain customised circuits because of the types of games, but they all use the same technology: a basic frame processor that controls the circuits, driven by a small program in ROM (the 8 PONG games chip has a 512-word program). Therefore, the MPS-7600 chips are not like the other PONG chips: they are customized microcontrollers.\nColeco used a very uncommon cartridge format: a silver triangular case which connects horizontally on the top of the console. Nothing in common with the other black cartridges whith plug vertically.\nColeco released only four cartridges. The first one was sold with the system and the others were available separately for the price of $25. Two flyers came with the system to order cartridges #2 and #3.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text from <a href=\"www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pong-story.com<\/a><\/font>",

It is almost a pong but as it plays different games (not only pong) available on cartridge, it can be considered a console (the same way as the Odyssey). It was produced by Philips.\nThis is not a pong-in-a-chip system like many later pong systems. When you open it you only find discrete components and a few integrated circuits. There is no game built-in, but the system was sold with a Tennis game cartridge. Four more cartridges were available (Pelota, Skeet shooting, Racing and Ghostchaser). The cartridges only contain discrete components too, which complete the basic design of the system itself to produce a specific game.\nThe score is not displayed on screen, hence the two score sliders found on the case (ranging from 0 to 15). The controllers are quite special too: two long and thin sliders with one tiny red button each. The controllers are not connected to the system itself but to the cartridge!\nTwo knobs on the unit are used to switch video canal used and the handicap (difficulty level).",

        "description": "The Telstar was the first \"pong-in-a-chip\" system. Here is what says Leonard Herman abouth the Telstar in its excellent book \"Phoenix, the fall and rise of videogames\":\n<font color=\"#666666\">\"Coleco released Telstar in 1976. Like Pong, Telstar could only play video tennis but it retailed at an inexpensive $50 that made it attractive to most families that were on a budget. Coleco managed to sell over a million units that year. Ironically, one reason for the super sales can be traced to a severe chip shortage. Because of the onslaught of manufacturers who wanted to produce videogames, General Instruments under estimated the number of chips that they needed to fulfill the demand by sixty percent. Coleco didn't suffer at all from the shortage. Because they had been the first company to place an order with General Instruments, Coleco received a full supply of chips just in time for Father's Day 1976. No other company received an entire shipment of chips and many received only twenty percent of what they ordered ! With numbers like this it isn't hard to imagine how Coleco took the lead in the home videogame race.\"<\/font>\nThe system in itself is quite simple and offers only 3 games. The paddles are built-in the system, a common fact on the first pong systems. There's a 3 positions switch that controls difficulty (beginner : slow ball, big paddles \/ advanced : fast ball, big paddles \/ expert : fast ball, small paddles). If this is common to the first Telstars, this is quite different from most of the other pong systems which offer individual settings.\nAll these features are quite weird when you know that AY-3-8500 chipset offers 6 different games and more setting options... But here lies the \"marketing genius\" of Coleco. The Telstar was only the low range model of a whole forth-coming product line with enhanced features. Thus the first Telstar was intentionaly limited!\nThe \"World of Video Sports\" system seems to be a variant of the Telstar, but not different in any way...apart from the plastic overlay of course...",

That's where the name came from: JET-EM Aparat pentru jocuri pe ecran TV - machine for games on TV screen - if I remember well. It is indeed a Sinclair ZX Spectrum compatible computer. It didn't had any joystick connector (kempston or any other joystick) so I had to modify it to use a joystick. Another interesting thing about JET was that you\ncouldn't hear the program that was loading from the tape. On HC85, for example, you could hear that, let's call it noise, when loading the program.\nOutput signals:\n- pal video signal: PAL: 1 Vvv \/ 75 ohm;\n- radio signal: 1 mVeff \/ 75 ohm;\n- the signal for the cassete recorder: 05 Vvv \/ 1 Kohm\nInput signal from the cassete recorder: min 50 mVeff\nInternal beeper: min. 55 dB SPL\n<\/font>\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Costel Dumitru<\/font>",

        "description": "This system is totally diferent from any other Telstar pong system or console you might have encountered until now. It looks like a common pong but it doesn't play the common pong games. This one offers 2 kind of games: Shooting games and Pinball games. A gun is available for it.\nThe nice devices are the 2 flipper buttons on both side of the system simulating a real Pinball. There is also a big red button on top of the case to launch the ball in the playfield. This button may be used in two ways: a short tap will shoot the ball out slowly and a long press will shoot the ball out faster. Excellent!\nThe pinball game display is totally adjustable: 3 sliding knobs (on the left side of the unit) can adjust the playfield (bumpers and chutes) up and down so you have completely different ball action in each game. These are also very useful when the ball is stuck...you can move them enabling the ball to get unstuck. The scoring is also very complex depending on what you're hitting with your ball, including \"special\" scoring like in real pinballs. There are 2 playfields available.\nThe shooting games are more simple: one is a 2 player game where you have to hit the target before it disappears, and the other is a moving target shooting game.\nThe system is powered by a Coleco home made chip: the MPS 7600. This chip offers 6 videogames: 4 pinball games and 2 shooting games. The shooting games don't exactly look like the ones of the GI-AY-3-8700 chip or the AY-3-8500 chip. The external rifle was dedicated to these 2 shooting games. The graphic display of this system is very good for the era and is in color. There is even a digital scoring on the screen.\nThe base of the unit was also used to store the switch box and the AC adaptor. You had to place the plastic rubber bumpers (under the unit) yourself.\n_______________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Taneli Lukka<\/b> reports:\nThere are actually two completely different Coleco systems, both of which are called Gemini. Telstar Gemini shown here is the older and probably rarer machine. The second machine is an Atari 2600 clone by Coleco. They probably gave it the same name as the older console (without the \"Telstar\"-word) to hide it from Atari's lawyer armada. This worked for a while, but soon after the launch of the console Atari sued Coleco for braking copyright laws. The machine was a low-budget release meant for gamers with little money.<\/font>",

A power-on menu gave access to various language packages and several utilities: RS-232 setup, machine language monitor, text editor and terminal program.\nTechnically speaking, the 6502 and 6809 processors shared the same address and control lines so both CPUs worked on the same memory area except the Kernel ROM that remains independent of each processor.\nCommodore 8000 series owners could upgrade their system and make them SuperPets thanks to an optional upgrade package.",

Here is what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pong-story.com<\/a> says about it:\n<font color=\"#666666\">MOSTek, another manufacturer well known in the micro computer market, released a quite advanced line of video game chips in 1977: the MPS-7600 series. Rather than integrating the components of a complete PONG game, this type of chip contained some circuits to display graphics and generate sound effects, all of which were driven by a simple processor and a 512-word ROM (Read Only Memory). Four versions of this chip are known to exist. Each of them contains customised circuits adapted to the games played. For example, the PONG version (MPS-7600-001) that plays four games for two or four players has some special paddle and ball generators. This particular chip was also released in PAL format as MPS-7601. So far, only Commodore is known to have used it in a system (model 3000H).<\/font>",

No shooting games here...\nSomething rare for that time, the two tiny controllers are not hardwired to the system. This means that when one of them died, it wasn't necessary to change the whole system.\nThe shape of the case is weird. It looks like a case conceived for a small computer. Indeed there's enough room for a small keyboard instead of the actual panel control, and the bulk at the back could have contained a mother board or any other hardware...\nActually, this bulk is used to store the controllers when the system is not used, and there's also the cells compartment.\nWhen the system is opened, one can observe that under the control panel, several holes in the plastic case are not used by the system and are hidden by the black plastic film. For example there are two other holes for addtionnal controllers plugs. It thus can be imagined that the same case could have been used for 4-players game systems...\nIt is also interesting to note that many different brands used this particular case. The <a href=\"computer.asp?st=3&amp;c=657\">Alex Video Spiel TG-621<\/a> for example is the same system.\nOn the electronic board is written : 60-10<b>621<\/b>-01",

They simply did not put any rifle plug :(\nThe score is displayed on screen but there are two other sliders on the unit that allow the players to play set by set.

It's very odd looking, I mean, not a clone from another system but an original shape. Each paddle is detachable.\nNow, the funiest part: Inside the system is a mother board with SOE OC5000 written on it ! Well, the OC-5000 is a French pong produced by a French company (Soci?t? Occitane d'?lectronique). So, Fil just bought the internal components from SOE and included them inside their case.\nOne other strange feature: The OC5000 has a 9V battery plug but this one has only a plug for a 9v external PSU.

It did not have the ability to use cartridges but had 24 games built-in and could be played by up to 4 players simultaneously. But this console never made it to the shelves, and the Odyssey? (a complete different system in fact) was marketed instead.\nThe system is powered by an Intel 8048 microcontroller and a Video Display Controller (VDC) generating all audio &amp; video. This VDC, which is a custom Intel IC, can generate 4 different types of graphic objects: a background grid, single characters, quad characters (made of 4 single characters) and sprites. A maximum of 4 independent sprites can be displayed. There are monochrome and of 8 x 8 pixels in size. Of course the VDC can detect sprite collisions.\nThe Odyssey? has 64 pre-defined characters (letters and graphic symbols) in memory. Up to 12 foreground characters can be displayed from this internal character set. Many games (especially eraly ones) used a lot those pre-defined characters: man walking, right arrow, slopes, tree, ships, plane and a ball.\nThe flat membrane keyboard of the Odyssey? was a major selling point. It was meant to be used for game selection, educational games, programming, entering its name for hi-scores,etc. Apart from the game selection, it was hardly used.\nThough not as popular as the Atari VCS, or later Intellivision, the Odyssey? did well in the US and even better in Europe where it was marketed by Philips as the G7000 Videopac and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1060\">Philips C52<\/a> in France. Even the Odyssey3 prototype (which never came out), was somehow released in Europe as the Philips G7400 system, Videopac+ and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1093\">Jopac<\/a> systems.",

        "description": "The Hanimex HMG-7900 is a low-range console with rather simplistic games. It was released around 1983. It is one of these cheap systems produced in Asia for people not able to buy more expensive systems of that time.\nThough different in shape, the HMG-7900 is internaly the same system as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=822\">Rollet Video-Color<\/a> and the ITMC-SD290. The HMG-7900 itself was sold under different brands throughout Europe (Soundic Soundicvision SD-200 in Scandinavia for example). There were surely all produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as all the systems have code-names like \"SD-2xx\" (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!!\nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=792\">Cassette Vision<\/a> from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\nThe HMG-7900 is rectangular shaped, gray coloured and rather small (32 X 18 X 7 cm). It was delivered with only one controller which connects to the left side of the system. There is a second connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player controller, but as all the games were for one player only, it was never used. The controller can be stored in its compartment located on the top of the console. It is composed of a 4-directions disc on which can be screwed a little stick. There is also a knob for Breakout-type games and two orange fire buttons (which have the same function) located on both sides of the joystick.\nThe control panel is made of three buttons and an on\/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top-left part of the console, just above the joystick storage compartment. Below it is written: \"Programmable Color Video Game \".\nInside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Nothing is known about this one, it might be an all-in-one microcontroller... Hopefully Richard Gellman wrote to tell us more:\n<span class=\"soft-quote\">I did some searching on various internet resources to try and find out about the D779C CPU chipset. It seems to be completely obscure, and restricted to the ITMC SD-290.\nNEC were known for cloning other CPUS; The D780C was a clone of the Z80. The D779C appears to be more a \"system\" chip, like a microcontroller. It may be a custom-made Z80 MCU with certain features removed for cost.\nUnfortunately, as there is no information available I can not confirm this, so this is a \"best educated guess\".<\/span>\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.",

Designed for the home market, it was intended as a replacement for the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">BBC Micro<\/a> and like the earlier Archimedes models it was only really used in British schools up until very recently.\nAcorn started to phase out the Archimedes name and the machine was now simply badged Acorn A3000. Rumours have it that some of the Acorn A410 models had serious reliability problems and had to be recalled, so the Archimedes name was dropped to boost the machine's reputation.\n \nLike the Atari and Amiga computers it had a built-in keyboard and disk drive located on the right-hand side, but unusually it also had two stereo speakers on either side of the unit. This form factor is ideal for a school environment as it doesn?t take up too much space and was often used with a metal plinth allowing a monitor to stand on top, usually an Acorn-badged Phillips 8853 (AKF12) or 8833 MK11 (AKF17). \n \nThe A3000 had two expansion ports. The internal one was a cut down 8-bit version of the type found on the earlier Archimedes machines. The second one, on the rear of the case, was a 16-bit version fully compatible with both earlier and later machines.\nThe operating system could read PC 720K disks and provided improved facilities for hard disk and networking, as well as some apps included in ROM which would appear on the task bar, such as Paint, Edit, and other useful programs.\n \nThe A3000 was replaced by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=707\">A3010<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=706\">A3020<\/a> models in 1992.\n \nThanks to <b>Jonathan Hayward<\/b> for his help. \n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=697\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

In fact, the colors only differed on the keyboard marquee, the case color being the same. On the red version the background of the keys is darker than on the blue version.\nThe CIP-03 had a built-in Spectrum compatible BASIC interpreter in ROM. But instead of the original Sinclair copyright text at boot, it shows simply a \"BASIC S\" string on the center of the bottom line on the screen.\nThe computer had no joystick interface built in, it could been however purchased separately (in contrast, other romanian Spectrum clones had built-in joystick port.) The keyboard had switches instead of the membrane of the original ZX Spectrum. Though it had a clumsy feeling while typing, it did not wear out easily. The computer had an internal speaker of about 0.5 watts which  gave a very loud noise while loading programs, and there were no way to control the volume...\nApparently the CIP-03 is the most common of all Romanian ZX Spectrum clones.\nThere was another version called <b>CIP-02<\/b> which had only 2 KB ROM containing a copy utility program. The advantage was that the RAM available for copying was 60 KB, more than enough for copying a full 48k program.\nThe BASIC interpreter was available on cassette tape and needed to be loaded each time the computer was powered on (but not reseted as the 0-16 KB area was protected from interrupts).\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Sz?sz Edu?rd Istv?n (info)<\/font>\n<b>Calin Popescu<\/b>, the designer of the CIP-03 sent us this line:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI was the engineer who led the entire process - from design to manufacture - of this Spectrum clone at Electronica Bucuresti. I think we manufactured about 15000 units until I left Romania in 1993. The production continued for a while after that but I do not have more info. I do have own one protptype.<\/font>\n<b>Geroge Sauciuc<\/b> from Romania adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe CIP-03 was used in public schools, for informatics classes. this mashine was delivery with tape recorder, external power supply unit, and with one programs tape (all Romanian programs because at this period, all programs must be made in Romania). \n<\/font>\n<b>Liviu A. Stefanescu<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I am the RF designer ( electrical schematics final version after few revisions, PCB prototyping, several pilot runs, volume production) of the UHF modulator used in the HC models 85 and later. The UHF modulator was transforming the video composite signal into a TV channel signal specific to the standard D\/K, usually one of the channels 25..30 , manufactured by I. Electronica was similar to the one used for computers HC85 and later HC models produced by ICE-Pipera. The modulator was a stand alone module that was being added on the Main board as needed. Some versions were not delivered with TV modulator. \n<\/font>",

        "description": "The CIP-04 seems to be a clone of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=222\">Sinclair Spectrum +3<\/a>.\nHowever, despite similar or higher technical features (256 KB of RAM, 64 KB of ROM, built-in Floppy Disk Drives), the system was not compatible with all Spectrums because of its 3.5\" FDD instead of the 3\" Spectrum model (though the 3.5\" FDD was a better choice).\nThe 64 KB of ROM probably hold the 48K Spectrum BASIC, 128K Spectrum ZX+3 BASIC and CP\/M operating system\nAdditional information from <b>Grecu Cristi<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe CIP-04 is very close to Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3, probably the only +3 clone from Romania. It's ROM software is almost identical; but at power-on the message is \"(c)\" instead \"(c) Amstrad...\".\nThe menu is identical, with loader, 128 BASIC, Calculator and 48K basic. It has the AY-3-8912 sound chip, the video connector is also used for sound output.\nThe disk is managed through +3DOS, a method cloned from Amstrad's +3. The disk is 3,5\", single sided, double density, 40 tracks. It's somekind silly to use 720K floppies, and use only 1\/4 of its capacity! But I think this is also cloned from +3. The controller chip is a CM609P, a russian clone of the 8272. Being a total clone, I bet it can also run CP\/M.\nIt has a one-direction parallel port, providing 8 data lines, STROBE and ACK. No PIO was used, it is probably controlled by soft. It also has a serial connector, but no UART is used. Also probably driven by software. Transistors were used instead of the classic MC-1488. Very unprofessional!\nJoystick connector: Two Sinclair joystics. Uses keys 1..0.\nMemory: Although near the keyboard is said BIG, \"256 kbytes\", from the 128K basic interpretor we may access only 128 KB. The memory consists of eight K565RU7G, 256 Kbits each. So indeed, it has 256  Kbytes!\nTwo M27C256B (64 KB) hold the ROM software, just like the +3. I also saw about 5 more ROMs, MN74L287, 256*4 bits each. I don't know what are those good for.\nSomething stupid: The expansion bus is very close to the power supply jack, so there is no space to plug in a peripheral. Not even the original Electronica's joystick interface.\nPower supply issues: It needs 5V, plus on the central pin. Careful: Like all the CIPs, it hasn't internal stabiliser. +12V is provided inside for the serial interface and other chips.<\/font>",

VGA output and new extra screen modes were introduced as well using cheap standardised IDE hard disks.  The keyboard was the quality 'Brisbane' model as used on the previous high end Acorns.  (Or could 'Brisbane' be the codename for the A5000, as I discovered it inside the keyboard PCB when I did some repairs on mine?)\n \nMany A5000s were fitted with SCSI controller cards and used with caddy-type external CD ROM drives for multimedia applications.\n \nEarly models had just 2MB of RAM with a slot to allow a 4MB RAM card to be mounted on top.

For about 6 months, it was thus the world's cheapest computer.\nEven though is was slightly superior to the competition (Atari VCS), the unit was too expensive and the sales  remainded at a low level. \nIn 1982, Bally withdrew the system and sold the rights to Astrovision Inc., a group of users who had enjoyed the system. The console was then reintroduced as the <b>Bally Computer System<\/b>. The same year, the company changed its name - and the system name - to <b>Astrocade<\/b>.\nAfter that, Astrocade tried to keep the system alive and marketed it as a video game console for several years. In 1985, the game consoles market crashed and finally, the Astrocade company closed their doors and the Astrocade system disappeared.",

The system was sold in a brown suitcase so you could carry it easily and anywhere. In the upper part of the suitcase is stored the lightgun.\nThe buttons are very original and very cool to press (hehe, you can't imagine that feeling...). You can use the magnets sold with the system to keep the score by placing them on the sides of the metallic panel where numbered squares are drawn.\nThe console use a AY-3-8500G chipset from General Instrument offering 7 different games (Tennis, Hockey, Hockey handicap, Practice, Squash, Ball-trap, Tir cible). But there are two special options built-in the system which are quite uncommon :\n- A new game called Hockey Handicap. It's a classic hockey game where there's a third bat for one of the players.\n- But what makes the Visiomatic 101 quite special is a robot option that allows a single player to play vs the system in 4 games (Tennis, Hockey, Handicap Hockey and Squash). This function was not built-in the AY-3-8500G chipset, but hardware designed by Yves Kien, the Alcatel technician in charge of this project. The robot follow the ball movements but blinks on a fixed interval to give a chance to the human player. One of the first implementation of a robot feature in a pong system !\nLater on, Yves Kien developped a color version of the Visiomatic 101,called the Colormatic 211. It displayed green for the tennis and red for soccer. It was going to be sold in 1978 but got canceled.  \nA definitely nice looking pong with original options and graphical designs !",

        "description": "A classic pong from Roberts with four games (hence the name of the system) and detachables paddles. Apparently made in Japan.\nThe two paddles can be attached to each side of the system, or taken apart. There are only equiped with a unique dial. The general cosmetic design of the Paddle IV looks like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">Commodore 64<\/a> one. Round edges and beige\/creamy color. The games selection is made with a knob...\nPROMOTIONAL CATCHERS:\n- Featuring 4 games with detachable remotre control\n- Automatic on screen scoring\n- Simply attached to your black &amp; white or color TV set\n<b>Jeff Skowron<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I owned this system.  The games were pretty standard pong fare.  For tennis, each player had a paddle and the object was to keep the ball from going behind the paddle.  Hockey was the same, except the area behind the paddle that the ball could go through was restricted (i.e. representing the net.  I also believe that in the hockey game, each player controlled two paddle, both on the same side of \"center ice\", but one more forward than the other and slightly offset from each other.  As you might guess, in squash each player controlled a paddle on the same side of the screen and the object was to bounce the ball off the wall on the other side of the screen and get it past your opponent.  Squash practice was the single player version with just one paddle.  There were difficulty setting switches that made the ball or \"puck\" move faster, made paddles smaller, and, I think, altered the angles the ball took when it hit the paddles.  If I recall correctly, the first toggle switch on the top row in the picture allowed you to choose automatic or manual serve (only applicable for squash practice?).  In manual mode, you had to push one of the buttons on teh lower left of the console to serve the ball.  On a side note, putting the power cord in your mouth gives a bit of a shock! (I think my cousin dared me to do it)<\/font>",

The console is quite obscure outside Germany, but many \"software compatible\" systems can be found in many countries (at least in Europe). It's unclear if Interton really made the VC-4000 from scratch or if they bought the rights and the design to produce it, as many other brands produced similar systems the following years. The same thing will happen with very similar systems: Emerson Arcadia 2001 &amp; \"clones\"... \nAccording to the excellent research work from Dale Hansen, the <b>1292 Advanced Programmable Video System<\/b> from Radofin would be the first member of the line as it was released in 1976! Radofin then licenced its system wordlwide to different companies.\nThe VC-4000 is powered by a Sgnetics 2650A CPU (same as Arcadia 2001) and a Signetics 2636 Video Controller (Arcadia 2001 uses a 2637). The two controllers are composed of a 12 keys keypad, 2 fire buttons and an analog joystick. On the control panel of the system, one can find an on\/off switch and three buttons: RESET, SELECT and START.\nOne particularity about this videogame \"family\" (VC-4000 &amp; clones), is that they seem to be the only systems which required the game to be loaded into internal RAM from the cartridge, before being able to play (generally through a LOAD PROGRAM or equivalent button found on the control panel. On the VC-4000 it's the RESET button).\nAbout 40 cartridges were released (37 so far). The games are not bad for 1978, but not impressive too...",

        "description": "The Rowtron Television Computer System is another <a href=\"computer.asp?c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> \"software compatible\" system (saying \"clone\" would be misleading). That is to say that the internal specs are exactly the same and that games would run on both systems. The cartridge slots are however different in shape, so there is no way simply test that (with an emulator that would be easier).\nThere are two controllers composed of a 12 keys keypad and an analog joystick. Interton VC-4000 compatible systems usualy have this 12 keys PLUS one or two fire buttons. Here there are only 12 keys and one of these, the \"8\", is used as the fire button (it is thus colored red). However the quality of the keys is excellent (calculator type) compared to other systems... The top of the joysticks can be unscrewed and stored somewhere safe.\nThe control panel has always the same buttons found on all systems of this system family: Function (Start), Reset, Cycle (Options) and on\/off switch. Underneath one can find a useful sound volume switch. It's not ON and OFF but rather HIGH and LOW, which is helpful enough.\nSomething very strange about this console, is that on top of the case there is a plastic modeled rectangle at the exact place where it would have been logical to find the cartridge slot. But the real cartridge slot is found on the right side of the system, like an Intellivision... It sounds like the case had been designed for a top-loaded cartridge system, and they had to modify it at the last moment to implement the mother board they finaly got...\nOn the case is written \"Television Computer System\" as well as \"Home Entertainment Centre\". Wow, very promising... Underneath the system, there is label reading SD-090R. The letters SD are often found on obscure systems, and are supposed to mean SOUNDIC, an asian company which produced a lot of obscure systems, especially pong-based systems. But SD-090 systems are usualy quite different from the Rowtron. This remains a mistery to me. However, on the motherboard is written MPT-04, which makes much more sense! MPT-0x is often found on obscure system motherboards. We don't know yet who produced them (Soundic?) and sold them to so many brands but: MPT-02 are <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=728\">RCA Studio II<\/a> compatible systems, MPT-03 are <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Emerson Arcadia 2001<\/a> compatible systems and MPT-04 \/ 05 systems are <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> compatible systems!\nThe Rowtron Television Computer System can also be found under the Teleng brand.",

        "description": "The RCA Studio II was the second programmable video game system in the world, following the Fairchild Video Entertainment System released a few months earlier.  (The Magnavox Odyssey had cartridges, but was not programmable - the cartridges simply acted as jumpers to select games already built in to the analog electronics of the system).  When looking at the Studio II, it's clear that best-selling systems of that time, Pongs, inspired RCA.  Cosmeticaly, it looks like a pong...\nBut the Studio II is more than a pong, it also is programmable.  A total of 10 cartridges were released before RCA dropped the system in 1979.  The Studio II also came with 5 built in games: Bowling, Freeway (car racing), Patterns, Doodles, and Math.  Unlike Fairchild's system, RCA's was only in black and white and the sound was through a single channel \"Pong\" style beeper housed in the system itself.\nThe controllers are quite basic: only two numeric keypads built-in the system, labeled \"A\" for left player and \"B\" for right player. The numeric keypads are composed of ten keys numbered from 0 to 9. Arrows are also drawn next to the keys to indicate that \"4\" is for left, \"6\" for right, \"2\" for up, \"3\" for up-right, etc. \"0\" is thus often used as the fire button (depending on games of course).\nSadly, the RCA was quickly outdated (the day it was released some would say) due to the fast pace techat technology was evolving at.  9 months later the Atari VCS was released, with color high resolution graphics, custom sound that actualy came through your television, and what was to become one of the largest game libraries of any console to date...\nSome years later, color clone systems appeared in Europe.  They were clearly marketed as cheap systems for people who couldn't afford more \"modern\" systems like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=755\">Colecovision<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1018\">Vectrex<\/a>.  They include the Soundic MPT-02 Victory, Hanimex MPT-02, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1163\">Mustang 9016 Telespiel Computer<\/a>, Conic M-1200 and the Sheen 1200 Micro Computer.  Some have modifications from the original RCA Studio II such as detachable controllers or even color graphics.  There were also some new cartridges produced for these systems, such as Concentration Match for the MPT-02.\nIt is interesting to notice that MPT-02 systems are Studio RCA 2 software-compatible, MPT-03 are Emerson Arcadia 2001 software-compatible and MPT-04\/05 systems are <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> software-compatible systems...\nIf you want to learn more about the RCA Studio II and its clones, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/magazine\/view.asp?r=2&amp;a=5\">here<\/a>.\nIf you want to know how to build your own RCA Studio II switch box, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/magazine\/view.asp?r=2&amp;a=14\">read this<\/a>.\nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=543\">RCA Cosmac VIP<\/a> computer is also quite related to the RCA Studio II.",

        "description": "In 1986 the Acorn Business Computer range was long gone, and Olivetti -\nAcorn's new owners, having been forced to increase their stake from 49\nto 80 per cent of the firm - were concentrating on making Acorn more\nprofitable. The case for the 65C816-based Communicator was retained and\ngiven a basic box, housing a PSU and disk drive, to make a standard-looking 3-box computer system based around the BBC Master architecture.\nAlso marketed in Europe as the <b>Olivetti Prodest PC 128 S<\/b> (S for Sistema), the Master compact differed from other computers in a number of annoying ways. Most confusing was the decision to keep the computer in the keyboard, with suitable reductions in available interfaces and features such as the real-time clock - making the Master Compact rather like a grown up Electron (however, home marketing would unfortunately not be attempted - it would have been considerably more successful). The 'CPU' was connected via a large ribbon cable and a jack plug. The monitor connected to the 'keyboard'. It was, to be blunt, a mess.\nHowever, the system did introduce the 3.5\" drive as a standard to the 8-bit BBC range and featured all the usual Master enhancements plus a mouse\/joystick port. As a school computer - the traditional market - it differed just enough to make it relatively unpopular, lacking the user and 1MHz bus ports used by many educational devices, and being (by nature of its smaller case) somewhat easier to steal and damage. The Compact was discontinued very early on, the introduction of the A305 Archimedes offering a similar 'format' of machine, but with all the benefits associated with Acorn - expandability, speed, and reliability. The original one-box Master 128 continued to sell until 1993... \nOlivetti were to get their own back for the Compact - Acorn sold a\nbranded version of the Olivetti M19 'PC Compatible', a rather dated 8088-based machine.\nThe Olivetti Prodest 128 can be seen in the kid's film 'Treasure Island in Space' - an Italian production, most likely. The computer is recognizable by its blue and white display.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n_______\nInfo, texts and picture by <b>Richard Kilpatrick<\/b>\n<\/font>",

An optional 20MB Winchester harddrive was also available.\nThe Tiki-100 could read various disk formats, like Scandis, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM-PC<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=181\">Osborne<\/a>, and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=357\">ABC-800<\/a>. The 80 KB format was the same as used in some <a href=\"computer.asp?c=15\">Xerox-systems<\/a>.\nThe operating-system was called <b>TIKO<\/b>, and was compatible with CP\/M 2.2. It was first called <b>KP\/M<\/b>, but was renamed at the same time as the computer changed the name from Kontiki-100 to Tiki-100.\nOne could also install an optional Intel-8088 processor-board, adding an extra 256 KB ram to the main 64 KB. A 16-bit operating system called <b>TIKOS<\/b> was used together with the i8088 board, and managed both the i8088 and Z80 at the same time. TIKOS was developed from CP\/M-86, and was compatible with it. MS-DOS 2.11 was also available.\nThe Tiki-100 had 3 (maybe more?) graphics modes, but no text-mode as it used\nbitmapped graphics only.\nA separate network hub was available that allowed up to 8 (not sure) computers to be connected in a star topology. One of the standard Tiki's serial ports was used for the network, in high speed mode. The server was a Tiki-100 that ran MP\/M.\nSeveral programs were developed for the Tiki-100. Most common were: <b>BRUM<\/b> (a simple wordprocessor), <b>Tiki-Kalk<\/b> (Spreadsheet), <b>Tiki-BAS<\/b> (Database),<b>WordStar<\/b> and <b>SuperCalc<\/b> and a little snake-type game called <b>Pyton<\/b>.\n A simple terminal program was also imbedded in the OS, and made it possible to\nconnect to a BBS through a 300 or 1200 bps modem. A serial terminal could be\nused to acces the Tiki-100 via one of the serial ports.\nProgram languages like: C, Fortran, Cobol, BASIC, Pascal was also available.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Jon Andre Finnerud<\/b> and <b>Jorn E.Haugan<\/b> for information and pictures.<\/font>",

        "description": "In 1989 Psion expanded their range, previously based around variants of \nan 8-bit handheld computer called the Organiser, into full size laptops. \nThe Organiser had proven to be very versatile within business, becoming \nthe standard tool of British Telecom, Marks &amp; Spencer and many other \nbusinesses, with barcode readers, interfaces for printers and \nmeasurement devices, and robust construction with solid-state storage.\nThis reliance, and expertise, with solid-state storage led Psion to \ndevelop a 16-bit laptop range with no 'soft' storage options. The 80C86 \nbased devices introduced EPOC - still in development as an embedded OS \nand used in PDAs and computers like the Nokia 9210, Series 5 and Series \n7 - though now handled by Symbian.\nInitially consisting of 3 similar systems, the MC range started with the \nMC200 - a 256K system with a 640 x 200 screen taking up half the space \nin the clamshell style top half. Unlike Psion's later PDAs, the MC had \nvery conservative styling with the exception of the large touch-pad \nbelow the screen, and relied on good quality, especially for the \nkeyboard and screen. The MC400 expanded the screen to 640 x 400, \noffering a good size display compared to contemporary machines - many of \nwhich were pure DOS and didn't offer the GUI of the MC200 and 400.\nThe final version used the 3.84MHz 80C86 for the OS more commonly \nassociated with it - DOS 3.x. Psion's MC600, despite this apparently \nretrograde step, was seen as the flagship offering 640K RAM and \nadditional keys in place of the touchpad on the EPOC based systems. The \nrelatively high price of the system ensured it had little success in the \nfast moving PC compatible 'portable' market - however, the benefits \nPsion's past products offered still applied, and British Gas were \namongst the companies adopting the MC600 for on-site work.\nWhat did the MC range offer that marked them out from the existing \nlaptops on the market? Original plans were ambitious - Psion's other \nresearch included compressed audio, and a planed CODEC (COder\/DECorder) \ncombined with an existing audio in\/out bus was intended to offer \ndictaphone like capabilities. Interchangeable modules, mounted in the \nrear of the machine, would offer different interfaces (including the \nCODEC), and the successful (for Psion) SSD - Solid State Disk - was \ncatered for with 4 drives. The drives are compatible with the Series 3, \nthough little software exists for the MC. The lack of a backlight \ncombined with Psion's experience with portable electronics resulted in a \nremarkable battery life - around 70 hours on AA cells, and 20 with the \nrechargeable battery pack. The keyboard was excellent, high quality and \nfull-sized, and the built-in software included a basic Text editor, OPL \nprogramming language, and terminal emulation. They were capable of basic \nmulti-tasking, too. Interestingly, Psion's MC-link package was one of \nthe most remarkable methods of connecting to your PC or Macintosh - you \nhad access to the host machine's Filesystem on the MC, in fact it was \neasier to control transfers from the MC than the host!\nWhat they didn't offer was any sense of security. Within 2 years, Psion \nwere direct selling them with a new Word Processor, branded as the \nMC-Word. The MC200 was long gone, and the MC600 remained for corporate \nsales only. Windows-based laptops contributed to the failure of the MC \nrange, though none offered the immediacy and battery life, or light \nweight. A year later Psion would almost deny that the machines had \nexisted, the Series 3 leaving it's mark on the consumer market and \nproving Psion's competence beyond any doubt...\nThe MC's architecture did survive, in the form of the professional HC - \nHandheld Computer. This also spawned a ruggedised Series-3-alike, the \nWorkabout, which also saw the introduction of backlights on the Series 3 \n(the 3a) and future Psions. However, Psion didn't return to the \n'notebook' market with any vigour;  the Series 7\/netBook being a sadly \nlimited product that, whilst remarkably competent and efficient, lost \nthe lead to Microsoft's Windows CE platform, especially with CE Pro \nmachines like the Hewlett-Packard 820. It's another sad loss, as Psion \nmove out of hardware production and another British company threatens to \nfade from view - Psion Teklogix will continue to market products for \n'commercial' use, but the Psion brand will disappear from consumer items \nin a year.\n______\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nText &amp; info from <a href=\"mailto:richard@dmc12.demon.co.uk\">Richard Kilpatrick<\/a><\/font>",

The control panel is composed of 10 buttons to select the different games offered by each cartridge (10 being the maximum). Difficulty switches, power switch and a start button can also be found.\nPrinztronic marketed another very similar system which used cartridges based on GI chips: the Prinztronic Tournament. Though different in shape, it is basicaly the same system. Can anyone confirm if cartridges for each system can be used in each other?!\nThe Prinztronic 5500 was marketed in Europe and Oceania (New Zealand). In Germany it was sold as the SHG Blackpoint (different models exist).\nThe Tank Battle game produced by the AY-3-8710 chip from General Instruments, is often missing from available cartridges for this type of systems (based upon GI chips). There is one good reason. All the other games use analog controllers whereas the Tank Battle must be played with digital controllers (like direction buttons for example). And all these video-game systems were designed with analog controllers and no numeric ones. However, some systems, like the Prinztronic Micro 5500 (and the SHG Blackpoint) offered optional digital controllers (pads with 5 buttons: directions and fire) with the Tank Battle cartridge...",

This title appeared on the front cover of the July issue 1974 of an electronic hobbyist magazine called <b>Radio-Electronics.<\/b>\nThe Mark-8 was an Intel 8008 \/ 256 bytes RAM memory based system without neither ROM monitor, power supply, case, video, keyboard, nor backup interface. Consequently, the user had to enter program instructions each time he turned the system on.\nTo build this computer, the home computing fanatic had first to buy for $5.50 the 48 pages instruction manual written by <b>Jon Titus<\/b>, the creator of the system,  from Radio Electronics. Then order the circuit board from an Englewood, New Jersey based company for $47.50, and finally provide himself with various components, including the Intel 8008 processor for about $250. About 7500 home computing fanatics ordered the instruction manual and 400 of them the main board. Very few of them succeeded in running the final assembled system as it was a very long and full of traps job.\nThe LED display featured 4 rows of 8 leds. The two upper rows displayed the address bus (14 leds) and processor cycle state (2 leds). The third row displays an 8-bit memory data, and the fourth, the 8-bit value available from the output port 0.\nMost of the fanatics who tried to bring the Mark-8 to a running state gave up and bought a few months later the first versions of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=62\">Altair 8800<\/a>, the first real personal home computer.\nIf you want to learn more about the Mark-8 computer, you should read the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.his.com\/~jlewczyk\/adavie\/mark8b.html\">page<\/a> written by Jon Titus, the Mark-8 designer.\n <b>To note:<\/b> Pictures of this page show a Replica version of the Mark-8, not an original system.

In fact, Commodore enlisted the services of Porsche Design, a separate firm from the famous car maker that specializes in the less glamorous world of industrial design. PD was founded as a side project of Ferry Porsche, Ferdinand's son.\nThe PET 200 was sold only in Europe.

He had to provide himself with various components, including the MOS MSC6502 processor.\nThanks to <b>Jeffrey R. Owen<\/b>, the owner of the pictured system, who relates us:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nWhen the KIM-1 was announced in 1975, my order was immediately placed.  The price was US$150. I received a KIM-1 with serial number 285.  The 6502 at that time did NOT have the ROR instruction.\nAbout a year later, seeking more flexibility and wanting to use the newly added 'ROR' instruction, I purchased a TIM,an MCS6502\nwith the 'ROR' instruction, and two MCS6532's.\nI constructed a simple computer, much like the one in the TIM manual, on a kludge board.  No box, it was powered by a lab supply.  Features and circuits were added, and removed as required.  Mounting it in the brown box with power supply was done in 1979, oneof the last modifications. It was then a small development system including a 2708 PROM burner (ZIF socket outside box), and a three position switch selecting the memory map presented after reset.\nI gave my KIM-1 to a friend in Teheran when we left Iran in September 1978.  I kept the TIM which was just a circuit board at the time.  We left Iran by taking a train to Moscow, then another to Belgium. When leaving the USSR, the customs officer looked at the board, and called a specialist, who quickly identified every chip and indicated that there was no problem.\nLong after it had ceased to be a development system, the TIM served as a printer switch, allowing three computers to share a printer, and using A 2708 EPROM containing the printer switch application code in the ZIF socket.\n<\/font>",

The processor was a Z80 with 64 KB of address space.\nThere were two versions : the larger one used a proprietary multi-user operating system, one feature of which was the use of a lightpen for much the same purposes as today's mouse. The smaller machine used CP\/M without lightpen interaction. The computer was mainly sold to small companies for administration and bookkeeping purposes.\nThe machine's hardware was designed by H.A. Polak, the console by Vos Industrial Designers. The disks and the system electronics were in a separate refrigator-sized housing (a desktop box for the smaller system); the console shown in the picture mainly contains a converted MicroBee terminal. \nThe Holborn company was founded in 1979, it's head office was in Holten (Hol born). The company has been active until 1983, when it bankrupted. Like most manufacturers of computer systems of original design around the world, it hasn't survived the competition of IBM and the IBM-PC-clone builders. About 200 machines were sold, 50 of them of the larger variety.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.science.uva.nl\/faculteit\/museum\/\">Computer museum of the University of Amsterdam<\/a> for text and pictures.\n<\/font>",

Curiously, both machines came with a BBC Basic interpreter on\nwhich users could develop their own applications.\nThe NC 100 was a ?199 notebook computer the size of a piece of A4 paper, with a full size keyboard and a \"letterbox\" screen at the top, offering 80 columns by 8 lines.\nIt had an RS232 serial port and a Centronics parallel port for printer and communications. Built-in were 64 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 1 megabyte with the addition of an add-on memory card.\n\"If you can't use this new computer in five minutes, you'll get your money\nback,\" boasted the company in its launch advertising. For ease of use, it had\nfour colour-coded keys giving instant access to a number of built-in\napplications, including a word processor, calculator, diary and address book.\nAt a time when an entry-level lap-top computer cost more than ?2,000 and the\nsub-notebook had not been invented, the NC100 and NC200 offered a good value\nalternative for those with basic computing needs, such as word processing on the move.\nAll the NC computers were made in Japan by Nakajima. The company also sold its own version of the NC-100, called <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1143\">ES-210<\/a>.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Graeme Burton<\/b> for information about NC series computers.<\/font>",

It featured an 8080 processor and could implement MCS-80 (8080) based computers and Intel Series 3000 systems.\nThe main unit needed a Serial video terminal or an ASR-33 Teletype to be connected, as well as a paper tape puncher\/reader and\/or floppy drive unit.\nSiemens sold in Germany a local version  of the first Intellec called <b>SME-800<\/b>.\n<b>Series II<\/b>\nThe Intellec series II Model 230 included  a 2000 character CRT, a detachable full ASCII keyboard and dual double-density 8\" diskette drives providing over 1 MB of data storage.\nISIS-II Diskette Operating Software allowed the Model 230 to be used for assembly and\/or compilation and debugging of programs for Intel's MSC-80 (8080), MCS-85 (8085) or MCS-48 (8048) microprocessor families.

        "description": "After the success of their Telstar pong systems in the late 70's, Coleco decided to re-enter the videogame market, inspired by the success of cartridge based systems like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari VCS<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellivision<\/a>.\nAs the Colecovision was released later than these competitors, it was possible for the Coleco engineers to put more hardware in the box while keeping the cost acceptable. The Colecovision is thus powered by a Z80A cpu running at 3.58 MHz. It has 8 KB RAM, 16 KB VRAM, three-channel sound and a powerful video display unit (Texas Instruments TMS9928A) offering 16 colors, 32 sprites and a 256x192 resolution. The result is that when the system was finaly released in summer 1982, it was immediately considered the most technologicaly advanced home console. The games simply had arcade-quality graphics!\nBut even with this technological superiority, Coleco had to face the competition of Atari big arcade hits licenses and Intellivision realistic sports simulations. Coleco did not have enough money to compete with Atari for big licenses, so they secured licenses for small games with strong followings like Mr DO, Lady Bug, Cosmic Avenger and Venture. And Coleco's good relations with Sega resulted in a Zaxxon cartridge that sported excellent 3D effects.\nBut the best was to come: one february 1, 1982 Coleco and Nintendo signed an agreement which gave six-months exclusive license for Donkey-Kong! Their excellent version was thus exlusively sold as a pack-in with Colecovision as an incentive to purchase the system, and it worked! The Colecovision was an instant success.\nColeco marketed different add-ons for their console. The Expansion Module #1 is an Atari VCS adapter wich enables the Colecovision to play Atari cartridges! Coleco sold 150,000 Atari adapters in just two months... Atari sued Coleco for $850 million, but lost the case.\nThe Expansion Module #2 is a complete driving controller with steering wheel, acceleration pedal and gear shift. It was shipped with Sega's classic racing game Turbo. The Expansion Module #3 is the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=57\">ADAM computer<\/a>.\nA rollet controller was also sold to play games like Slither. The Super Action joysticks, a massive and complete controller, was used to play sports games like Super Action Baseball and Rocky Super Action Boxing.\nColecovision was a great success, selling over six millions units in just three years. Unfortunately, the ColecoVision suffered the same fate as the rest in the great video game shake-out of 1984. Coleco's unsuccessful bug-ridden <a href=\"computer.asp?c=57\">ADAM<\/a> computer only complicated the problem, and Coleco stopped production of the ColecoVision in 1984.",

Each GI chips was able to generate several games, ball games for a start, then later car racing, motorcycle, submarines, tanks and shooting games.\nThe system has two detachable controllers with one analog joystick and one fire button each. The control panel is composed of 10 buttons to select the different games offered by each cartridge (10 being the maximum). Difficulty switches, power switch and a start button can also be found. There are also three small buttons labeled \"color 1, 2 &amp; 3\" which are used to change the display background colour!

Additional ROM software could be added thanks to two 128 KB cartridge slots.\nA rechargeable Ni-Cad battery pack allowed ten to twelve hours of continuous use, and a lithium battery kept the content of the RAM memory when the system was turned off.\nDue to various RAM\/ROM configurations in the system, the drive letters assignation was specific to the Dulmont: drive A corresponded to the software in ROM, drives B and C, to each optional ROM expansion, D to the internal C-MOS RAM, E and F to the external floppy disc drives.",

Actually, the cheaper version was a single floppy disc, single user system that was never sold. A practical small business multiuser configuation, called System 10, and including a 10 MB hard disk and 512 KB of RAM costed about $9000.\n \nThe system could support up to 4 four-port serial terminal controllers and several other peripheral controllers: storage modules, Parallel interfaces, high resolution graphic board and Ethernet network board. The keyboard was a close cousin of the Wang word-processing system one. Keys was well arranged and color coded. The system came with different hard-disk storage options, 5, 10, 20 or even 70 MB on latest models.\nThe Fortune 32:16 was a true multiuser multitasking Unix based system offering services that was a length ahead over CP\/M's. However, both Unix and Fortune was new to most of the dealers and users. Fortune offered them training courses in hardware, operating system and application software. \nA wide range of high quality business application software was available, as well as programming  languages, like a very extended BASIC able to convert code written in other BASICs (AppleSoft, MBASIC, CBASIC, TRS-80 BASIC), PASCAL, FORTRAN 77, COBOL and, of course, C language.\nThe 32:16 was also built and sold in France by Thomson under the name of <a href=\"computer.asp?c=89\">Micromega 32<\/a>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=767\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The C64 GS (Games System) is basically a C64 motherboard in a simple beige plastic case without a keyboad, serial port and tape interface. Apart from some minor ROM changes the circuitboard inside is exactly a C64. Thus it can play all the C64 cartridges that don't require interaction with the keyboard. Some cartridges were specificaly produced for the C64 GS, but there are a few... These cartridges could also be used with the original C64 or C128 both being equiped with the same cartridge slot.\nPriced at ?99.99 in UK (Christmas 1990), the console was packaged with a joystick and a cartridge containing International Soccer, Klax, Flimbo's Quest and Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun. But as history told us, putting aging computer technology into a gaming system, never made it a winner... The Amstrad GX-4000 (using CPC hardware), the Amiga CD-32 (using Amiga hardware), the Atari XEGS (using XE xomputers hardware) or the C64 GS never became top selling systems. The companies usually tried this strategy to desperatly compete with new waves of systems. For the C64 GS that was Nintendo NES and Sega Master System. The Megadrive was even released a few months later as well as the Nintendo Superfamicom (at least in Japan). Given this information, it's clear that the C64 GS, or the Amstrad GX-4000 released at the same time and same price, could not compete...\nMoreover, for a few bucks more you could buy a real C64 computer! The C64 Games System was only sold in UK in 1990, and Denmark in 1991...It was a massive flop. 80,000 units were produced; less than 25% of them eventually sold. Most of the remaining units were taken back and dissassembled for parts for the 64G.\n_________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Taneli Lukka<\/b> from Finland reports:\nThe machine actually has a cassette connector and user port on the motherboard, but there are no holes for them in the case, it seems that either the machine was originally supposed to have the ability to play tape games too (would seem quite likely, you really only need one or two buttons to load a game from tape) or then it was cheaper to manufacture the motherboard with fewer changes compared to the C=64 computer. There might have also been some peripherals planned for the user port, but both the cassette compatibility and the user port thing must have been scrapped well before release because there are no holes for them in the case. These ports did enable Commodore to use the unsold machines as parts for C=64 computers when the console bombed.\nThe machine came packaged with a Cheetah Annihilator joystick, which is probably one of the worst joysticks of all time. It's a real wonder why Commodore didn't use one of their own sticks (which are all manufactured by other companies,  they just have C= stickers on them) which are not very good either, but atleast you can play with them.  The reason might be that The Annihilator just matched the colour of the machine. <\/font>",

All featured a detachable keyboard, the same 1.02 MHz\n65SC02 processor, the usual scattering of expansion slots around the motherboard\nand the half-height case.\nGraphics modes and sound capabilities were in line with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=83\">Apple ][e<\/a>. On the front panel,\nit had a row of LEDs for Power, Diagnostics, Double-high-res Graphics Mode,\nHi-res Graphics Mode, and CPU Activity.\nThe back panel featured RS-232 serial ports (2), 1 DB-25 parallel port, 15-pin RGB video, and the power cable. The case and power supply had integrated fans. The case had the\nindentations for areas of expansion cards to poke out and provide new\nconnectors; however, these expansion slots were not located in a nice row,\n1-6. Slot 1 was missing (this was the parallel port on the back), slots 2\nand 4 were combined into one slot (it was one or the other set via a jumper,\nnot both), slot 3 was located near the rear and ran left to right, not from\nto back, slot 5 was located on the right side of the case and faced outward\ntowards a screwplate covering the connector face and ran perpendicular to\nslot 3. Slot 6 was also missing, as it controlled the two disk drives.\nLow-res graphics mode provided 16 colors in a 320x200 array, with a 2-4 line\n'text window' at the bottom of the screen. Hi-res graphics gave you 512 x 384\npixels at either 4, 6, or 7 colors (depending on which software\nwas used). There was supposedly another graphics mode, dubbed\n'Double-High Resolution' which was supposed to give you 16 colors at\n512x384, but there was a dearth of information about how to program in it.\nThe Franklins could run AppleSoft BASIC and <b>DOS 3.3<\/b>, but they shipped with\nthe Franklin DOS 2 floppy <b>FDOS 2<\/b>. This allowed for such things as\nprogrammable function keys. Otherwise, there wasn't a whole lot different.\nFDOS and BASIC were the keys to the enhanced graphics modes. If you had it,\nyou could run Integer BASIC through a convoluted process. Booting Integer\nBASIC had an interesting secret: if you 'peeked' and 'poked' enough, you'd\nfind the memory address for a reset. When Integer BASIC was reset, it\ndisplayed 'Apple ][' across the top of the screen. There were also numerous\nreferences to 'S. Wozniak' and 'S. Jobs' embedded in many of the programs Franklin delivered for it.\nThe Ace 2000 series was in fact the last Apple II compatibles made by Franklin. (~ 1987).  Franklin then tried manufacturing PC clones before finally devoting themselves to pocket translators.\n<font color=\"#6666\">Thanks to <b>Nathan Shrider<\/b> for all this info.\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The Casio Loopy (subtitled My Seal Computer SV-100), was a 32-bit games console sold exclusively in Japan. Released in October 1995, it was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to the female market.\nOnly 10 games were released for it, most being in the GxB and dress-up genres.\nA very interesting feature of this machine was that it included a built-in thermal color printer that could be used to create stickers from game screenshots.\nAn optional accessory, called \"Magical Shop\", allowed the machine to be used with outside devices (such as VCRs and DVD players) to obtain images from them, add text, and make stickers from those as well.\nThe machine features only one controller port, and a mouse port. Looking at the case one can spot a cartridge slot, a huge blue eject button, a power on\/off switch, a yellow reset button, and a red power LED. The right side of the case houses a... printer. Printed documents come out from the front of the system (right side).\nAs you see, little is known about this obscure console. Help is largely welcome!!\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> David Glover<\/font>\n<b>Josh Moor<\/b> reports :\n<font color=\"#666666\">I just found a loopy console for sale and bought it up very quick because I had never seen one before.  It uses standard AV outputs on the back instead of requiring a special adpater as some systems do.  There is also a contrast knob on the back.  The cartridges look much like a Super Nintendo Cartridge.  I don't read Japanese but the game I played appears to be a make over game where you customize the look of anime girls.  All the pictures in the instruction books are of girls playing so it is more then likely geared towards them.  There is also an add-on that inserts into the cartridge slot.  It says word processor on it and has AV inputs on it.  If you insert a game, it plays the game normally and it might like you take screen shots but I am not sure.  If there is no game, it comes up to a menu with several options.  The booklet for it shows people inserting pictures from variuos sources.  I will try to upload some pictures of it onto my site later.<\/font>",

        "description": "Due to lack of interest in marketing of MSX-machines and growing interest in game consoles and powerful PC alike computers (for word processing purposes mainly), companies were not so enthusiastic about creating a new MSX-machine. The biggest software supporters of MSX deserted to Nintendo and other computers\/game machines. Sony chose to make their own game console as well ASCII in cooperation with Yamaha and Panasonic created the 3DO (Three Dimensional Objects) game console. \nThis system is a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=290\">MSX Turbo R<\/a>. It is one of the last MSX computer ever made. It is the successor of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=291\">MSX 2+ systems<\/a> and thus has many characteristics in common. New features include a new PCM sound chip which can sample sound up to 15 KHz and replay up to 22 kHz. There is an internal microphone for the PCM unit. There is also an additional CPU, the R800 wich is a 16-bit RISC processor. The user can select the CPU (Z80 or R800) by software. 6 LEDs are placed on the case (Power, Caps-lock, Kana-lock, Pause, CPU mode, FDD in use). The system was delivered with a painting program on disk.\nPanasonic stopped the production of the Turbo R when they launched the 3DO game system in 1992. They failed with this system and never returned to MSX.\nLot of extensions, however, were produced by third-party companies to enhance the Turbo R, among them, an OPL4 Sound Card, a VGA card with lot of hardware sprites and IDE or SCSI interfaces.\nThe FS-A1 ST will be followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=627\">FS-A1 GT<\/a>.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Source : The Ultimate MSX FAQ<\/font>",

        "description": "The PDP-8 was the first sucessful commercial minicomputer, produced by DEC in the 60s, the first real minicomputer, and the first computer costing less than $20,000.\nBy late 1973 to 77, the PDP-8 family was the best selling computer in the world. The basic version could sit on a desktop rather than requiring cumbersome racks well known at the time. This compact size caused it to become a popular system in scientific laboratories.\nThe machine had a now quite strange 12-bit word and four thousand 12-bit words of magnetic core memory. The first model was built without any Integrated circuit - thus no microprocessor - but with discrete transistors mounted on numerous small printed circuit boards called 'flip chips' that were inserted on two backplanes mounted vertically. Both table-top and rack-mount models were available, but adding additional memory required a rack.\nCPU was composed of 12 interlinked Register Boards each operating on one bit slice of the 12 bit word and containing an Adder function together with all the major registers - MB, MA, AC, PC. Speed a little less than 1MHz.\nThe instructions set of the PDP-8 was very limited, only eight basic instructions encoded by the three left bits of each 12-bit word, and one register, the accumulator: However, the PDP-8 could be programmed to do almost anything. It just took longer (sometimes very longer!) to execute programs. \nA 110 baud current loop teletype interface allowed an ASR 33 Teletype to be connected, serving as a console as well as a storage device by means of the  built-in papertape puncher and reader.\nThere were numerous variations of the original model over the years, among them:\n1966: <b>PDP-8\/S<\/b> - minimum price but slow memory serial logic design \n1968: <b>PDP-8\/I<\/b> - first version with integrated circuits \n1970: <b>PDP-8\/E<\/b> - New bus structure design called Omnibus \n1975: <b>PDP-8\/A<\/b> - Allowed OEMs choice of memory type and quantity\nAll together, about 50,000 PDP-8 series computers were sold, as well as numerous clones made USA, Asia and East European countries. \nIn 2000 year, there were still a few PDP8's in operation, mainly in third-world countries.",

        "description": "From 1950 to 1965, electronic analogue vacuum-tube computers were used to design, test and run civilian and military equipment like aircraft, ships or rockets. The first systems were very expensive. However, components cost (especially vacuum tubes) was steadily decreasing. \nIn 1960, Heath Company launched the Heathkit EC-1, the first analogue computer (almost) anyone could afford. It was sold in kit or pre-assembled forms and was quickly and widely used in industry and universities. \nUnlike our modern binary computers which accept only two values as entry (0 or 1), an analogue computer represents input and output data's in voltage levels. So, any positive or negative value could be read directly from the built-in meter. An external oscilloscope could be also used as a display device, as well as a grapher for printed results. \nIn spite of its apparent simplicity, the EC-1 could solve a multitude of complex mechanical and mathematical problems thanks to nine DC operational amplifiers, three initial condition power supplies, potentiometers, relay contacts, high precision resistors and capacitors, and a built-in oscillator for repetitive operation (from 0.1 to 15 operations per second).\n \nThe computer was described by Heathkit as \"<i>Excellent teaching aid for a course in computer electronics - Vividly illustrates the electronic analogies to mathematical problems - Handles problems as complex as fluid flow, damped harmonic motion, and flight of a projectile in a viscous medium<\/i>\"\nComputer problems could be 'programmed' by inserting several patch cords into the problem-board sockets and thus linking in chain several built-in components together. \nThe EC-1 and other analogue computers were used until 1965, when first affordable digital computers became  available. \nHere is some EC-1 unusual technical features taken from the Heathkit brochure:\n<b>Amplifiers<\/b>: Open loop gain approximately 1000. Output -60 +60 volts at .7 ma.\n<b>Power supplies<\/b>: ? 300 volts at 25 ma electronically regulated; variable from +250 to +350 volts\n<b>Repetitive operation<\/b>: Multivibrator cycles a relay at adjustable rates (.1 to 15 cps)",

The price of the software and the hardware was strictly limiting them to video edition professionals.\nThe HB-G900F was later replaced by more advanced models such as the HB-F900 and HB-G900AP.\nThe coolest thing is that one of these systems could be found in the MIR space station, apparently used for video capture.

        "description": "The Cassette Vision is a japanese console released on the 30th June, 1981 by Epoch Co. This is for sure an obscure system as little is known about this console. It was one of the first cartridge system released in japan and ha d almost no real competitor until the launch of the fabulous <b>Nintendo Famicom<\/b> in 1983. It was however clearly a low-end and cheap system.\nThe graphics are very basic and blocky. The overall aspect of the games and cartridges (size and plastic boxes), is strangely similar to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=696\">Hanimex HMG-7900<\/a>... Though games are not the same, there must be a link between these two obscure systems.\nThere were not a lot of cartridge released for it. \"Kikori No Yosaku\" was its killer game. It is a game where you must chop trees! Other games include Grand Champion (car race), Galaxian, Big Sports 12 (paddle games), Baseball, Astro Command, Elevator Panic, Monster Mansion, Monster Block, etc. The machine did cost 13500 yen and games, about 4000 yen.\nThe controller are in fact two knobs for vertical and horizontal movements (like the Magnavox Odyssey). There are also 4 fire buttons labeled PUSH-1, PUSH-2, PSUH-3 and PUSH-4 (two for each player?). There is also a power on\/off switch, SELECT, AUX. and START buttons, a strange switch called COURSE and two others labeled LEVER-1 and LEVER-2... can anyone help us finding the use of these?\nThe Cassette Vision was later followed by the <b>Cassette Vision Junior<\/b>, which was a low-cost version of the Cassette Vision, and then by the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=844\">Super Cassette Vision<\/a>, a more well known system since it was also released outside Japan. Worth noting are also two stand-alone consoles which had each a single game included (and no possibility to play any other games). There were released before the Cassette Vision. First one was called <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1017\">TV Vader<\/a> and played a Space Invaders type game. The second one, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=798\">TV Baseball<\/a>, was a system playing only a Baseball game. It is interesting to note that both games would be released later for the Cassette Vision as cartridges.",

Thus it could accommodate the same APL interpreter, permitting the use of APL programs. A BASIC interpreter was also available, depending of the 5100 version chosen.\nThis was the first widely marketed and supported personal computer, and definitely the first useful all-in-one, portable computer system. However, it was a very primitive machine that was largely unsuccessful due to its high price tag (basic version costed $8,975) and limited expansion capabilities.\n \nIt had a built-in tape drive and a small 5\" 64 character display. A special display mode allowed the user to select right or left bigger 32 chars. of each line.\nThe tape drive used a 1\/4 inch DC300 tape cartridge and stored 204 KB of data.\nThe 5100 didn't feature a microprocessor chip, but a card called PALM (Put All Logic in Microcode) which acted as a 16-bit microprocessor.\nNotice that the 5100 is the first serial number of IBM \"Personal Computer\" range that will later include the 5110, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=794\">5120<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">5150<\/a> (IBM-PC) and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=286\">5160<\/a> (PC-XT).",

        "description": "With the innovative design and power of the PC-FX, the face of videogaming has changed.  Sporting a 32-BIT V810 processor, millions of colors, and one of the highest quality FMV in any home video game system, the PC-FX is definitely the system to get your hands on for some great gaming excitement.\nIt all started with the joint collaboration of NEC Home Electronics and Hudson Soft of Japan that spawned the PC-FX on December 23, 1994...\nThe PC-FX is one of the most unique video game systems ever made. Instead of the usual \"flat &amp; square\" designs associated with video game systems, NEC decided to use a different approach when designing the PC-FX. One main factor was making the system expandable.  In the PC market, this concept was already in full swing. Basically, if you compare a desktop PC to a tower PC, the latter will almost always have more expansion room. So, breaking away from the common console design, it was decided to create a tower video game system that offered (in the final design) 3 expansion ports for additional upgrades, and peripherals. \nIn addition to playing PC-FX games, the unit could also play audio CDs (with an expansive CD menu control screen), CD+Gs, and Kodak CDs for viewing your home photos.  This option allowed you to zoom in\/out and rotate the photo at will.\nThe PC-FX had 3 expansion slots. The front expansion slot was primarly used for the FX-BMP, a memory expansion module that allowed you to save games to it, rather than the FX internal memory.  The rear and bottom expansion ports were available for connections to the PC-9800 series of computers made by NEC.  One of those connections were used for a PC-FX-to-SCSI adapter which allowed the FX to be used as a SCSI CD-ROM drive.  To the rear of the unit, you can also find direct A\/V, S-VHS connections, and the power cord. Voltage and other power information can be found to the top of the rear panel.\nThe PC-FX control pad should be familiar to anyone who has played the PC Engine.  It is composed of 6 action buttons, run\/select buttons, and 2 mode switches. The mode switches would give the 6 action buttons special features in games that supported them. For example, in Kishin Doji Zenki: Vajura Fight, when you turn on the mode option, the top 3 action buttons become special moves, when regularly you would have to do a D-pad movement to execute the moves.  Additionally, NEC also released the PC-FX Mouse which was supported in most of the Anime Freak FX series of games and in some RPGs for faster control.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text, info and picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/pcenginefx.com\">pcenginefx.com<\/a><\/font>",

        "description": "The Vector Graphics VIP was also called <b>Vector 3<\/b> because it was based around the Vector 3 terminal which had an integral 72 key keyboard and 12\" video screen.\nThe unit had a six slot S-100 bus board which came with a Z80A processor board fitted with 56 KB RAM. The board also had a serial interface and three 8-bit parallel I\/O ports. The VIP configuration originally came out with a 340k  Micropolis Floppy Disk drive.  Later this was a 640k Tandon hard sectored floppy drive.\nNot shown configurations had a dual floppy drive or, for the 3005, a 5 megabyte Seagate ST506 drive.\nThe Vector 3 ran CP\/M operating system and all its associated professionnal software.  It came with <b>Memorite III<\/b> word processor, <b>Execuplan<\/b> (a form of planning program like Visicalc), and the Microsoft BASIC interpreter.\n<b>Peachtree<\/b> Accounting was available on Vector machines as well, probably the first implementation on a microcomputer.\nAnecdotally, Vector Graphics Inc of California  was started by two housewives in the late '70s. They were called <b>Lore Harp<\/b> and <b>Carole Ely<\/b>. The third founder, <b>Robert Harp<\/b>, was technical director. The Harp's were divorcing, which ultimately brought the company down.\n_________________________________________________\nMore information from <b>Dennis Wingo<\/b> who used to work at Vector Graphic:<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe CPU was housed in an 18 slot (the MZ box) S-100 Chassis designed by Vector. In late 1977 early 78 Vector went to the Z80A processor on a single board. The boot ROM (2k) resided on the Prom\/RAM card.  Later versions updated the PROM\/RAM card to 8k using 4 kbyte PROMS and one 1k of Fast Static RAM for the processor Stack. The processor speed went from 1 MHz to 4 MHz during that period.\nin early 1981 Vector engineer <b>Corey Selby<\/b> redesigned the Processor Card, PROM\/RAM card and Parallel I\/O card into the ZCB or Z80 Single Board Computer.  It had a 4 MHz, later a 6 MHz Z80B CPU. The ZCB incorporated two serial ports via and 8251A serial I\/O controller. It added an Intel 8020 24 bit parallel I\/O port controller, 4k of PROM and 1k of Static RAM.\nLater this design was integrated into the motherboard of the Vector 4 Single Board Computer along with an Intel 8088 that we built and released starting in 1982.\nThe VIP System shown above had a six slot S-100 card integrated behind the picture tube behind the Mindless Terminal (MT) CRT. In this six slot system there was a ZCB a Floppy Disk Controller Card or an FD\/HD (Floppy Disk\/Hard Disk) (Single floppy version shown above) controller.  Also plugged into the S-100 motherboard was a 56k DRAM Card, and an 20 X 24 Memory mapped video card with 2k of Fast SRAM (Flashwriter II Card).  \nIn very late versions of the Vector 3 series was an FD\/HD card with a ten megabyte Seagate ST506 interface hard drive.  This system was also connected to other computers via an 750 kilobit token passing Local Area Network (LinkNet).  The LinkNet card allowed up to 256 different Vector Computers to be hooked together into a seamless net where you had shared disk and printer resources.  This system was a pioneer in the computer industry as the first low cost microcomputer system to have this capability.\nThere were several interesting configurations of the vector system.\n<\/font>\n<b>Ullrich Moser<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI had pretty much this computer with a 5 MB hard disk built in.\nExecuplan was a fully functioning spreadsheet and if remember correctly, better than Visicalc.\nMy machine had Magic Wand as word processor.\nOne could buy a (terribly expensive) sheet feeder and write mass mailings just like with a Wang machine for a fraction of the price.\n<\/font>",

It is a stand-alone system, as it can play only one game: baseball!\nIndeed, baseball has always been very popular in Japan. It was logic that it inspired first videogames there.\nThe game can be played by two players, one launching the ball and the other manipulating the bat. There is a detachable controller with only one fire button, and all the other controls are on the system itself.\nIt is interesting to note that this baseball game is apparently the same (?) found on cartridge for the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=792\">Epoch Cassette Vision<\/a>.",

The T100X was a \"pen-based computer\" (This was before the term \"tablet PC\" existed) which ran on a 25MHz 386 AMD CPU. It shipped with 4MB RAM and had a 40MB hard disk drive for storage. It did not include an internal floppy disk drive, but a separate external floppy disk drive could be purchased.\nSimilar to most modern tablet PCs, the T100X did not have a built-in keyboard, and mouse pointing was done with a stylus. However it did contain ports to connect an external keyboard and serial mouse. It also contained two Type II PCMCIA slots, but it has been said configuring PCMCIA devices to work properly was often difficult. A parallel port adaptor was also included.\nThe display consisted of a backlit 9.5\" grayscale touch-sensitive LCD with a standard VGA resolution of 640x480 pixels at a color depth of 16 shades of gray.\nThe T100X was often shipped with Windows 3.1, along with specialized drivers (Microsoft Pen Services for Windows 3.x) to enable pen and handwriting support in applications, and to allow the stylus to function as the mouse.\nThe T100X weighed approximately 3.3 pounds, amazingly lightweight for portable PCs of the time (This was back when notebook computers easily weighed at least 8\npounds).\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Torin Darkflight<\/b> for info and pictures.\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "Made in the UK by Compukit in New Barnet, North London, the UK-101 was originally a copy of the  Ohio Scientific <a href=\"computer.asp?c=860\">Superboard II<\/a>. Two years and various legal battles later the UK-101 became, technically, behind its erstwhile rival.\nYou could buy the UK101 as a kit or as ready made for an extra fee. The kit came in a cardboard briefcase, in which there were anti-static tubes containing the 65+ ICs, a box of IC sockets, and bags containing passives (mainly 0.1uF ceramic decoupling capacitors) and keyboard bits (the keyboard switches were soldered directly to the PCB).\nThe UK101 came with a transformer in a plastic case, which was rectified and regulated down to +5, the regulator's heatsink was far too small and it would run very very hot, causing the RF modulator to drift channel. Many people relocated the regulator off-board onto a bigger heatsink to solve both problems.\nIt came with an A4-size book authored by Dr. A.A. Berk, covering assembly, trouble-shooting, and circuit diagrams with descriptions.\nThe UK101 was based around the 6502 processor. On top of ASCII characters, 128 graphic characters were available in ROM. The RAM memory was expandable from 4 KB to 8 KB on board, or 40 KB with an expansion board.\nAt the time, The UK101 was heavily supported by Watford Electronics in the UK,  and by various electronics magazines who published circuits. There were many user groups and plenty of software available. It was thus possible to upgrade this machine beyond all recognision !\nSeveral cases were also  made and sold by a number of manufacturers.\n_______________________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Paul Mansfield<\/font>\n<b>John<\/b> reports to us:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere were 3 monitor chips available, this being the 8k rom. The only one I can remember the name of was the Cegmon, the latest in the series.\nThe 40 pin expansion slot offered some inpressive (for the time) abilites. Mine had a sound card in it but I also saw systems with colour, hard drives and 5.25 floppy systems.\nSome boards had links in them in place of the two sockets on your picture. These needed to be removed if you wanted to use the 40 pin expansion and a couple of 8T28s (buffer chips) put in their place. Other expansions I saw included a 'graphics' chip that could be switched in using software. A small pigiback board replaced the Normal character chip (which is the horizontal one in your picture) with the graphics rom and normal character rom slotted into it. This gave 256 additional characters, and since the replacement rom was an Eprom these new characters could be anything.\nProgramming was via Microsoft 8k Basic and involved a lot of Poke instructions to get it to do anything much. Overclocking was a breeze, but you had to get it right otherwise the screen divided into 4!\n<\/font>\n<b>Martin Ward<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nYou could upgrade the graphics RAM by \"piggkbacking\" two new RAM chips on top of the existing chips, with one pin sticking out sideways which had a flying lead soldered to it. This gave you 48 characters x 32 lines.\nThe tape recorder could also be \"overclocked\" to 600 or even 1200 baud!\nRAM cost about ?10 per K (?5 per 1KB x 4bit chip).<\/font>\n<b>Dick Greening<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">An interesting story is that one of the BBC engineers rewrote the garbage collection routine (in the Microsoft Basic 4 Rom I thing it was,) only to find later that somehow Microsoft had incorporated his routine in their new version of Basic. He was able to prove it was his program as he had encrypted his name in the program! \nSound a familiar story!<\/font>",

The unique fire button is placed on the left of the controller so that it can be pressed by the thumb (if you are right handed). Thus you can play this system with only one hand. In fact, you left hand will naturally want to grip the kind of handle placed at the left of the system... There is the START button there, that you can easily press with your other thumb.\nOn the system itself, one can find a PAUSE button, a red power LED and power on\/off switch.\nWhile \"Compact Vision\" is written on the box, cartridges, etc., the translation of the japanese name (also found on the box, cartridges, etc.) would be something like \"TV Boy\"...\nGames were sold on cartridge. The number of released ones is not known by us, but looking at the box of the system, it seems that at least 6 games were available.\nThough we have little information about this system, we know that its video processor is a Motorola MC 6847. Indeed, looking at the screenshots, the colors, resolution and overall feeling, it sounds familiar to systems like <a href=\"computer.asp?c=155\">Laser 200<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=163\">Tandy MC-10<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=117\">Dragon 32<\/a>...\nFrom the MESS emulator team:\n\"The Gakken has nothing in it except a 6847, one 2k ram and some logic. The cart contains only 1 chip, a MC6801 microcontroller. It's the main CPU + ROM + RAM. We have no idea how to dump it or even if it's possible. It has 4k maskROM, but at $300 per chip decapping isn't feasible.\"",

        "description": "The Gradiente Expert Plus is a Brazilian MSX 1 computer. It is composed of two parts: the main unit and the keyboard. Gradiente is a Brazilian consumer electronic products company. It is not suprising as the unit's design looks like a HI-FI system... Along with the Hot-Bit, the Experts were the only MSX systems available in Brazil. The first model (Expert XP-800) was in fact a clone of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=587\">National CF-3000<\/a>.\nIt is a quite complete <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX 1<\/a> computer with two cartridge slots placed on the front panel and a numeric keypad. The system is powered by the MSX engine, a kind of super-chipset, gathering the CPU, video, input \/ output and audio functions.\nThe Expert can be used as videotext terminal (Telesp) with the TM-1 cartridge which includes a 1200 baud Modem, a serial interface and a phone socket...\nThe Expert Plus follows the Expert XP-800 (released in 1985) and the Expert GPC-1 (1986), which are quite similar. The Expert Plus was released (1989) at the same time as the <b>Expert DD Plus<\/b> which is the same system with a built-in floppy disk drive (720 KB).\n<b>Marcelo Ortega<\/b> from Brazil adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe Expert Plus and DD Plus had a big incompatibility problem, that actually was not Gradiente's fault. Both machines used the MSX engine SMT chip, that made things easier to Gradiente assembly these computers, solving the bad contact problems of the socketed chips used in the previous Experts, and replacing three chips by one, but the MSX engine chip mapped the RAM to a internal secondary slot.\nThis was OK for the MSX standarts, but most brazilian software was written to run in Experts and Hotbits without secondary slots, and this resulted in many crashes.\n \nThe Expert users were also waiting for a MSX2 machine when the Plus was launched, and along with the common crashes, this made these machines not so popular.\nThe DDPlus uses a internal disk controller board that was quite similar to the external cartridge interfaces sold then. It also uses 16Kb for MSX DOS, resulting in 48Kb of ROM. The drive is very good (mine still works flawless !) but it was painfully slow.\n<\/font>",

Plus, it was backlit, which made it very bright and readable.\nDOS could be run on this system, but needed a boot disk to do anything.\nDue to a very high retail price, very few Spark were sold (at least in Australia). In the US, the price was about $1000-$1200, depending on the amount of memory and whether 1 or 2 drives.\nThe closest (decent) competitor to the Spark was the Toshiba T-1000. A very well-made laptop, but its screen was only about 3-1\/2\" x 7\" and much less readable.\nDatavue made it up until 1993, then the company went under due to the many more powerful laptops on the market at the time.

The ROM monitor provided basic functions: enter program and data, display memory content and processor registers, save and load programs from a tape recorder.\nA whole range of peripherals and expansions were available from independant suppliers, as well as a vast range of software and many user groups. Several magazines dedicated to the Nascom and its relatives, the Gemini computers, were published. Many languages were available including BASIC, PASCAL, C, FORTH, etc.",

        "description": "The Casio FP-6000S is Casio's most ambitious computer for overseas market. It has been marketed in all of Europe's countries. However, it is also Casio's biggest (and costiest) failure on the market. It was hindered by three things : it was pretty late to arrive to the marketplace (developed in 1984, it only arrived in Europe in 1986), it was very expensive (US$ 10000 for a system with monitor, FDD and HDD), and the distribution channels (accustomed to watches and calculators) did not know how to sell this beast. Moreover, it was NOT IBM compatible, although it was indeed MS-DOS (ver. 2.11) compatible, which certainly did not help. Very few specific software was developed for the 6000.\nThe FP-6000S still has a beautiful, modular design. The CPU unit is housed in a tall vertical white unit with a grey faceplate. The on\/off switch is bright orange (the white and orange colors has been consistently used by Casio for its professional computer range). The 94-key keyboard was one of the best mechanical keyboards ever produced, along with IBM's 'M' \"clicky type\" model. The CPU has three slots for expansion. Both the mono and color monitor are antiglare and have a very good image quality.\nThe CPU offered 256Kb standard memory, upgradeable to 768 kb using 256Kb ram boards. Hence, up to two RAM boards could be added. Since these would eat all the available slots on the FP-6000S, Casio produced a special expansion cabinet (FP-6060S-IO) similar to the one of the FP-1000 line (FP-1060 I\/O), therefore adding 5 more slots. Which would total 3+5 (-1 for the expansion cabinet board)=7 useable slots.\nAll the disk and expansion units are housed in same sized and shaped cabinets. User had the choice of adding 1 or 2-drive, 5.25\" (320kb or hi density 1.2 Mb), or even 2x8\" (1.2 Mb). The FDD unit was connected through the FDD Interface Board, using one of the slots of the FP-6000S. An optional splitter box (FP-6051) allowed to connect two disk cabinets, for up to 4 floppy disk drives total.\nThe Hard Disk Drive unit offered similar modularity. One could start with a 10-MB HDD, and daisychain a second 10-MB Unit. Later on, Casio offered 20-MB models. These were connected using an dedicated Hard Disk Drive Interface Unit, using another slot.\nThere were a lot of options available to the FP-6000S, which concurred to increase the cost of a complete system. The most curious one was the 64kb Video Ram Expansion (consisting of 8x8kb chips), since the standard video ram was only 32kb. Having 96kb video ram total allowed use of all of the hi-resolution graphic modes in color.\nOther options included a mouse (with an interface board), a GPIB interface board, a printer board (up to 2 printer boards could be added), a printer buffer board (with 32 Kb RAM), a \"universal\" board (a bare PCB in fact), and an RS-232C interface.\nThe Casio FP-6000S used MS-DOS 2.11, which supported directories. it also sported a high-end Basic language, the C86-Basic which was a simple DOS executable consisting of a loader (C86BASIC.EXE) and an overlay (C86BASIC.BIN). C86Basic took up some 50 to 60 Kb, leaving very small useable memory for BASIC programs on an 256Kb machine. The FP-6000S had a fantastic demo Casio used on trade shows and such, with sound and graphics, that only runned on a 512kb machine with 96kb Vram. Like all Casio Computers, C86-Basic used 10 program zones, and was upwards compatible. One could  transpose pretty easily programs coming from the FP-200's C85-Basic and FP-1000\/1100's C82-Basic. An extended graphics command set (for that time) allowed for lots of graphics fantasies, including virtual\/ layered screens, adaptive X-Y coordinates and graphic modes (from 160x100 upto 640x400).\nThanks to <b>Joscelyn FLORES<\/b>, fond of Casio computers, for all this information.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=820\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The computer system consisted of two units - <b>EC362<\/b> and <b>EC372<\/b> - that could be used independently or linked together to provide a complete system for computer education.\nTo enable the input of relatively long programs and the output of computed results, an ASR33 Teletypewriter with 8-hole punched paper tape input and output was connected to the two linked units.  In addition, a textual output was printed on an 8 inch (200 mm) wide paper roll.\nUnit EC362 was the Arithmetic Unit and unit EC372 was the Core Store and Control Unit.  Both units had the same physical size (about 1m high x 600mm wide x 600 mm deep) and the large size allowed the units to be used in a classroom, either singly or jointly, in a demonstration mode.\nEach unit had a removable, push button, input console connected to its parent unit via a long connector. This feature allowed input and control of the units at the same time as allowing students a full view of the mimic diagrams on the front of the units.\nThe lamps on the mimic diagrams could be arranged in groups of either three or four yellow and white lenses.  This feature provided the opportunity to use OCTAL coding or HEXADECIMAL coding without having to make wiring changes.  The use of different groupings of the coloured push button key tops provided the same facility for input coding.\nBehind each of the removable consoles was a set of switches that were used to insert predetermined fault conditions to allow the teaching of faultfinding procedures.\n<font color=\"blue\">\nSpecial thanks to <b>Brian Townsend<\/b> who gave us this venerable machine.\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The Rollet Videocolor is a low-range console with rather simplistic games. It was released around 1983. It is one of these cheap systems produced in Asia for people not able to buy more expensive systems of that time.\nThough different in shape, Rollet Videocolor is internaly the same system as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=696\">Hanimex HMG-7900<\/a> and the ITMC-SD290. There were surely all produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as all the systems have code-names like \"SD-2xx\" (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. The Videocolor motherboard for example, is labeled SD-270. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!!\nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=792\">Cassette Vision<\/a> from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\nThe shape and look of the Videocolor is quite funky, all yellow coloured with big blue buttons. It was clearly intended to be sold as a toy and manipulated by children. There is one built-in screwable joystick mounted on a disk, one fire button and a dial to play breakout games. Though there is a second controller connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player, it was never used, as all games were for one player only. This connector is exactly the same as those found on the Hanimex HMG-7900 for example, so these controllers could be used with the Videocolor.\nThe control panel is made of three big buttons and an on\/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top part of the console. Inside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Nothin is known about this one... can you help please?\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?).

Hopefully Richard Gellman wrote to tell us more:\n<span class=\"soft-quote\">I did some searching on various internet resources to try and find out about the D779C CPU chipset. It seems to be completely obscure, and restricted to the ITMC SD-290.\nNEC were known for cloning other CPUS; The D780C was a clone of the Z80. The D779C appears to be more a \"system\" chip, like a microcontroller. It may be a custom-made Z80 MCU with certain features removed for cost.\nUnfortunately, as there is no information available I can not confirm this, so this is a \"best educated guess\".<\/span>\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system).

        "description": "This very classical system-in-a-paddle is a pirate Atari VCS 2600 clone with 127 built-in games (but no cartridge slot). Produced in China, it was released under several brands (NICS in the US, SystemA in UK...) all over the world. This system was sold until recently in France by a local company : AKOR.\nEverything you need to have fun playing good old 2600 games (excluding the TV set) is built in the system : CPU, games, control pad. While the second version (aka TV-Boy II) needs to be connected to the TV set via an A\/V connection (SCART or standard RCA cable), the first one (TV-Boy I) includes a cheap wireless video transmission system : an antenna can be plugged into the RF Out connector, converting it in a (very) short range video emitter. You can also use a normal RF cable.\nThese two versions have a few other differences : the TV-Boy I has two Atari joysticks connectors which the TV-Boy II lacks (in two-player games, the pad controls both players at the same time...), and the version II has a better mother board design, probably in order to lower the production cost.\nThe system uses a bank switching technique and the 127 built-in games are accessed via an on-screen menu (the 128th program) so there is no dip switch as seen on some pirate x-in-one cartridges. This menu (that seems to be located at the lowest address of the ROM) is executed by default when the system starts and once a game is selected, there is no mean to come back, so one needs to restart the system to play another game.\nSeveral games have been hacked : the copyright marks and original publisher logos were removed, and some sprites have been modified. Most of them have been renamed.\nThe SystemA and NICS versions of TV boy II, does not have the A\/V connection mentioned. It's a straight RF lead to the TV. They also have a small II printed to the right and above the TV Boy logo. The game list is also slightly different.\nA third version, the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=825\">Super TV-Boy<\/a> was released later, including the same games and specifications, but with a very different design.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=827\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

The floppy drive front poped up to the right of the case to let the user insert disks.\nTwo main options could be acquired separatly: a docking station containing two standard card expansion slots and housings for a second floppy drive and a hard disk; and a disk adapter for adding an external 5.25\" or 3.5\" floppy drive. This adapter also featured a Parallel port and one short card slot. There was also an external battery pack that doubled the four hour autonomy of the main battery.\nLike its predecessors, the Kaypro 2000 was sold with a large bundle of software. In addition to MS-DOS operating system, there were the range of Micropro products : WordStar, Mailmerge, CalcStar, InfoStar, and StarBurst, a communications package from Mycroft Labs, and several utilities provided by Kaypro.\nThe Kaypro 2000 was licencied to the french company SMT which rabadged in 'Goupil Club' and sold it in France (and Europe?) with little success.",

Gradiente is a Brazilian consumer electronic products company. It is not suprising as the unit's design looks like a HI-FI system... Along with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=833\">HotBit<\/a>, the Experts were the only MSX systems available in Brazil.\nThe Expert XP-800 was in fact a clone of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=587\">National CF-3000<\/a>. It is a quite complete <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX 1<\/a> computer with two cartridge slots placed on the front panel and a numeric keypad. The rear of the system is quite populated with a lot of connectors : BUS Expansion port, Keyboard connector, Tape interface (1200\/2400 bauds), RGB video output, Composite video output (monochrome), Parallel port, Audio output, 2 x power out connector (Max 100W)... On later models (v1.1) a few connectors were added: 6v output for DataCorder, RCA Color Video Composite (PAL-M) and RF-Out with channel selector (PAL-M). A speaker level control and an AC Switch (120V-240V) can also be found.\nSadly, the cassette interface, RGB connector, keyboard connector, expansion connector and printer connector were not compatible with the MSX standard. Gradiente did this on purpose, trying to set their own proprietary standard in Brazil... Also, a little difference in the ASCII table between the Expert (corrected with the Expert GPC-1) and the Hotbit caused a lot of problems in Brazil...\nThe Expert XP-800 was later followed by the Expert GPC-1 (1986), the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=807\">Expert Plus<\/a> (1989) and finally the Expert DD Plus (1989).",

It was developped by Sharp and marketed by Epcom. It is a classic MSX 1 computer, with 64 KB RAM and two cartridge slots (one on top, and the \"expansion\" port on the side of the system).\nMSX systems did very well in Brasil and litteraly killed the previous micro-computer market populated with TRS-80, Apple II and Spectrum clones from local companies. Gradiente (sound \/ HIFI products) and Epcom\/Sharp (video products) were big companies, and put a lot of money in the marketing of their MSX computers.\nThough the Hotbit was more respectful of MSX standards than the Gradiente Expert, it did not win the marketing battle, and its production was stopped in 1988.\nThere are several versions of the Hotbit HB-8000: version 1.0 and 1.1 use a white case, while version 1.2, released to be compatible with the Gradiente Expert ASCII table (problem related to portuguese special characters), use a black case.\n_______________________\n<b>Djogo Patrao<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nBack on these days, the most annoying difference between Hotbits and Experts was in which slot were the RAM. A great deal of software didn't autodetected this, and assumed the Expert default, which caused bad (and wrong) opinions about Hotbit. <\/font>\n<b>Rafael Rigues<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">If you look on the back of a black Hotbit, you will notice that the area surrounding the ports is covered by a thin plastic mask, as it was originally recessed. Removing this mask, you will find a circular opening for an extra port marked RGB (the text is molded in the plastic). This leads to the speculation that this model was originally designed as an MSX 2 machine.\nHowever, I had the opportunity to help in an interview with the marketing manager of Sharp on that era, and he knew nothing about this. According to him, the 1.2 models are black simply to make them more appealing and fit better with A\/V equipment of the time.<\/font>",

One could find it also in LCD display drivers or as a serial port manager. \nIt has 16 instructions, including bit transfer, logical single bit comparisons (OR,  XOR,  AND, NAND), Jump and subroutines. Its internal clock speed started from manual pulses to about 1 MHz.\nThe pictured computer, made by a German anthusiast, worked when connected to a 9V battery. It includes a LED IO board, CPU board and 512 byte RAM board. The keyboard featured one key for each processor instruction and an octal numeric keypad. Some sounds may be produced through the attached amplifier and loudspeaker.\nMore information from <b>Kai Ludwig<\/b>:<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe MC-14500 based \"WDR-1-Bit-Computer\" was invented about 20 years ago as a holiday-project by <b>Burkhard John<\/b> and <b>Volker Ludwig<\/b> for educational purposes.\nIn those days I was running the german company \"DATANorf Hard and Software\". It sold the \"WDR-1-Bit-Computer\" as kit. The ciruitboards were homebrew and there were many additional modules available.\nLater we made an 6 part educational school-TV-serial with WDR Television and the German company Raffel-Electronics got the licence for professional distibution of the kits with industrial manufactured circuitboards.\nYour picture shows a version sold by DataNorf to a home enthusiast. The attached board contains a NE555 oscillator to make a sound. The pitch can be adjusted by the potentiometer. \n<\/font>",

This console group includes : the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=829\">Ormatu Spelcomputer 2001<\/a>, Advision Home-Arcade, Prestige MPT-03, Tele-Fever, etc. and the Arcadia 2001.\nAll these systems (based on the 2650 &amp; 2637 chipsets) are \"software-compatible\" with each others. It means that they all could play each other games if their cartridge slots were identical (which is not the case, resulting in sub-groups).\nThe Arcadia 2001 sub-group includes : Advision Home Arcade (France), Bandai  Arcadia (Japan), GiG Electronics Leonardo (Italy), <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1178\">Hanimex HMG-2650<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1177\">Leisure-Dynamics Leisure-Vision<\/a>, Intercord XL 2000 system, Eduscho \/ Tchibo Tele-Fever, etc... It means that all these systems can directly use the same cartridges.\nThe Software library is not very impressive, but there are good reasons for that. First, some titles ar almost just direct ports from \"Interton VC-4000 &amp; compatible systems\" group. Philips (remember, at the origin of this ystem) also had great plans for his new hardware platform. It released adaptations of famous Arcade classics (Pac-Man, Berzerk, Phoenix, etc.) but Atari sue them. Philips was then forced to deeply modify those games, resulting in poor adaptations... at least for the Arcadia 2001. Because, outside US, other compatible systems sometimes had un-modified version in their library (Robot Killer for the MPT-03, for example).\nThe Arcadia is equiped with two detachable controllers made of a screwable joystick, a 12-buttons keypad (flat membrane buttons) and 2 fire buttons (they in fact have both the same function). Small plastic layers were delivered with each game, explaining the different key functions when placed over the keypads (like with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellisivision<\/a>).\nThe Control panel is made of 4 buttons (Start, Clear, Select A and Select B) and the power on\/off button.",

Sadly, out of the 2 KB of available RAM, only one was available for BASIC program and variables. Hopefully, an optional 2 KB RAM extension was available. \nPrograms could be listed or executed using the red diode display or the built-in alphanumeric printer. They was saved on Olivetti specific 2.5\" 3 KB mylar minidiscs through the built in disc drive.\nThree versions of the P-6040 were sold. The first allowed programs to be created, edited and executed; the second  only allowed programs to be read from the minidisc and executed; the third, stangely, allowed programs to be created and saved but not executed.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Steven Williams<\/b> for the donation of his P6040!\nThanks to <b>G?rard Touitou<\/b> for information and pictures\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The Mega Drive was renamed Genesis for its 1989 American launch. \nLack of awareness of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1240\">TurboGrafx-16<\/a> left the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=866\">NES<\/a> as the Genesis' biggest competitor until the release of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">SNES<\/a>. By this time the Genesis had established a large user base and was able to outsell the SNES in America. Shortly after the release of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (on Sonic 2's Day, which as you probably guessed was a Tuesday!) the Genesis held a massive 65% share of the market. \nHowever, the success of the console in the States, and as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1247\">Mega Drive<\/a> in Europe, may well have contributed to Sega's downfall. Two misjudged pieces of hardware, the 32X and Sega CD put a huge dent in Sega's reputation, one so large that the company would never recover. \nA redesigned <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=843\">Genesis II<\/a> was released in 1994. The smaller console was cheaper to produce, similar in concept to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1252\">Master System II<\/a>.\n________\n<b>Taneli Lukka from Filand adds :<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">Connecting the 32X addon to the original Genesis\/Mega Drive is very difficult because a special adapter cable is required to link the 32X unit and the MD console together. This happens because MD1 has a diffirent AV port than the MD2. This cable was very hard to get even when 32X was released (many people had to buy a MD2 unit to get their 32X working) and it's almost impossible to get your hands on one of these cables today.<\/font>\n<b>James (UK) comments :<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">I believe i have a seen two different versions which havent been mentioned here. the Mega Drive i own has a white piece of plastic around the power L.E.D, and no writing at all on the ring. it has no EXT port and all plastic feet and only mono sound from the a.v out port - i modified it for stereo by taking the output from the headphone port. The Mega Drive my uncle had was one of the first in the UK. That had a GREY piece of plastic around the led and had 'high definition audio' only written on the ring :)<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=837\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Thomson MO5E was first revealed at the \"Hannover Messe\" (Germany) in april 1985. It was a big suprise for the french press as no-one ever heard of this system before. The MO5E (\"E\" presumably for Exportation) was reserved for Germany and more generaly for foreign markets. Quite surprising when you know that while Thomson was selling this system to Germans and other countries, French could only buy the first version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=12\">MO5<\/a> with rubber keys, external power supply and no joystick connectors. Moreover, the MO5E with a light pen and a Quick Disk Drive was sold cheaper than the rubber-keys MO5 alone in France!!!\nThe MO5E is in fact a MO5 in a different case. The general look of this MO5 seems more \"serious\" than the original one with its big beige plastic case; closer anyway to the brand new systems that was released at that time (Commodore 128, Atari XE &amp; ST line, etc.). The QWERTY keyboard is a real full-stroke one, with separated arrow &amp; editing keys. The Memo5 cartridge slot is protected by a flipping plastic door, at the top of the case, just above the keyboard.\nBut the main differences are found elsewhere, when looking at the different connectors. First, two joystick connectors (Atari standard) are found at the front of the system, along with a big black reset button and a red power LED. This means that the MO5E has the \"Music &amp; Games\" expansion built-in! Indeed, the original MO5 has no joystick connectors, you have to buy this expansion. It also add more music features to the system resulting in 4 voices and 7 octaves.\nLooking at the back of the system, it is also quite different from the classic MO5. From left to right can be found a SCART female connector (not a SCART cord like MO5), RF TV video output which doesn't exist on the MO5, an expansion connector, a Centronics interface connector (not present on a MO5) and a the power cord meaning that the power supply unit is built-in the MO5E, which is also different from a MO5 which has a bulky external one. The on\/off power button is placed on the left side of the system.\nFrom a software point of view, both systems are identical. They both have the Microsoft Basic 1.0 (Level 5) found on the original MO5. The free RAM memory is also identical : 31008 bytes. In fact, the MO5E is completely compatible with the original MO5.\nThe MO5E didn't have great success abroad, and was, in fact, mainly sold in France to schools and border areas... Specific French models (with SECAM video output) were even produced as AZERTY models can be found.",

        "description": "The Sega Master System (SMS) was originally released as the Sega <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=806\">Mark III<\/a> in Japan.  It was released after Nintendo's <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=866\">NES<\/a> (Nintendo Entertainment System) and was never able to catch up to its level of success. The hardware was superior to that of the NES but the number of quality games on Nintendo's console far out numbered those on the Master System. \nThere were some quality titles on the system and it was also the first system to have a role-playing game (RPG) in North America. This game was of course Phantasy Star which was released in 1988. The SMS also enjoyed versions of Sonic The Hedgehog, Ghouls and Ghosts, and even Mortal Kombat. \nThere were some interesting peripherals for the system like the 3D glasses. They hooked up through the card slot on the system and with compatible software created a 3D effect. It worked quite well. One problem was you could see the shutter of the glasses while playing which detracted from the enjoyment of the game. There was also a light gun for the system called the Light Phazer. \nThe SMS could play two types of games; cartridges and Sega Cards. The cartridges were used most of the time. The cards were for smaller games (32 KB max).\nEarly in the Master System's life Sega sold the U.S. rights to Tonka. Sega thought that the toy company would be able to market the system better then they could but they were very wrong. In 1989 Sega took control of the U.S. rights again but by then it was too late. \nIn 1990, after the release of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Genesis<\/a>\/<a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1247\">Mega Drive<\/a>, Sega released a re-designed console, the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1252\">Master System II<\/a>, in the U.S. and Europe to try and cut production costs and attract new users.\nTRIVIA : Did you know that there is a hidden game called \"The Snail Maze Game\" in the Master System? To play this game, turn on your power base without a cartridge. While the Sega Master System logo is appearing on the screen, press and hold the directional button in the up position while simultaneously holding down buttons 1 and 2. Once the logo fully appears, the first maze will scroll onto the screen from the right. Have fun.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Adapted from Miles Mason's Master System text<\/font>\n<b>Taneli Lukka from Filand adds :<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">The AV-connector of the original Master System was deleted from Master System II together with the card slot to save in manufacturing costs. This only leaves the RF-connector for TV-output (for US &amp; UK systems) which is a bad handicap for today's players as the picture quality is very poor with the RF-lead. Because of this many collector's consoles have been modified by adding RGB-output. All Master System models also share one bad feature. This is the pause button which is mounted on the console itself instead of the controller so it's very hard to get to it quickly. The pause button and reset button are also identical so you can quite easily press reset instead of pause if you are not careful. Pray that you are not in the final level of Shinobi when that happens...<\/font>",

        "description": "The Visual 1050.  Entered into the PC battles mid-80s from the now defunct\nVisual Technology company (most famous for video terminals at the time).\nThis CP\/M based machine was tailored to Wordstar with a specialized\nkeyboard featuring all the wordstar function keys.\nGraphic capabilities were managed by a second 6502 processor.\nIt was delivered with a set of Digital Research software, including CP\/M, C-BASIC compiler, DR-GSX (graphic extensions), as well as WordStar (Word processor), Mailmerge (address database), Multiplan (spreadsheet) and TTY-1050 (communications)\n<b>John Citron<\/b> remembers:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI worked for Visual from 1980-1987. From 1983 to 1987, I was a hardware technician with them and serviced many of these machines. In addition to the expansion ports on the outside, there is also a riser header for a, never implemented, optional memory expansion card. The 9\" green monitor was manufactured in Taiwan by ADI and it, along with the keyboard, eventually became the main components for their V-50\/55 and V-60\/65 line of video terminals.\nIn addition to coming with a huge bundle of applications, the system was also able to read CP\/M disks from many of the competitive machines in its day. By running a special utility, one could load in programs and data from <a href=\"computer.asp?c=181\">Osborne<\/a>, DEC VT-180, DEC <a href=\"computer.asp?c=284\">Rainbow<\/a>, and others.\nOverall, the system was great in its day and I eventually owned one for a number of years. The video was crisp and the Keytronic keyboard was comfortable to use. The only complaint that I ever had was the noise. The system was very loud due to the empty case and the noisy fan and floppy drives.<\/font>\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Richard Bramante<\/b> for information and pictures.\n<\/font>",

It did not have the headphone jack, volume control or RF TV output. The A\/V port changed to a custom multi out port that now provided stereo sound to T.V's (previously only mono was output by the Mega Drive, the headphone jack had to be used for stereo sound). The power lead port was made smaller and a different AC adapter was used. Finaly the power switch was changed to a push button. \nBoth the original Mega Drive and the Mega Drive II could be connected to a Sega CD and 32X add-ons. The Mega CD was even remodeled to better fit the Mega Drive II. A specific version of the Mega Adapter\/Master System Converter was also designed.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Adapted from Miles Mason's Genesis 2\/Megadrive II text<\/font>",

There were five different lines developed over the few years the machines were produced: the P2000T, P2000M, P2000B (later called P2500), P2000C and finally the Yes, a MS-DOS machine. The weird thing about these different machines was that they were all incompatible with each other.\nThe P2000C, was probably the most advanced of the P2000 series and the early portable from Philips. It was a heavy luggable computer. In fact, users didn't pick it up and carry its 15 kg unless they really had to! Also as with almost all early portable machines it was not battery powered but mains only.\nWith its twin Z80 processors - the second was dedicated to I\/O - the P2000C was one of the faster CP\/M system, faster than most of the PC's of the day for several professional applications. Furthermore, it could run MS-DOS software thanks to an optional 8088 'CoPower' card.\nIts two 160 KB 5 1\/4\" floppy disk drives (later 2 x 600 KB) were able to read almost all the widely used CP\/M disk formats like those of Osborne and Kaypro.",

At the time, Olivetti was called <b>'Olivetti Underwood Corporation'<\/b>. The P101 was also the first programmable machine small and medium size companies could afford. Besides several tens of thousands machines were sold, mainly in USA.\nThere were neither microprocessor (not yet invented) nor integrated circuits in the P101, but only transistors, resistors and condensers.\nInstructions could be executed directly through the keyboard as in a conventional calculator or stored in memory and then executed by the Control and Arithmetic units.\nThe memory holds 9 registers that could store numeric data or program instructions. Each register could store one 22-digit number plus sign and decimal point, or two 11-digit number, or 24 program instructions. Five registers could store instructions, so the maximum length of a program was of 120 instructions.\nProgram and data stored in memory could be saved into a magnetic card thanks to a built-in cards reader\/recorder.\nThe calculator used a form of 'cache' memory for storing the results of the last operation. This was done with a <b>Pulse Delay Line<\/b>, a device that turned the data into mechanical vibrations along a wire, serial fashion.  A sort of 'SAM', Sequentially Accessed Memory.\nThe Pulse Delay Line was invented in the 1940's for RADAR and the crude computers of that time . \nOne year later, Olivetti released the <b>Programma P102<\/b> (pictured) which was the same machine but featured a serial RS232 connection and allowed printer, Teletype or paper tape puncher\/reader (up to four) to be connected.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Gerard Touitou<\/b> for information and pictures.<\/font>",

        "description": "The BBC Master was an enhanced version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=29\">BBC Model B<\/a> providing improved features, but sadly also introducing compatibility problems with earlier BBC systems. \nThese features were: loads more memory such as shadow, sideways and private RAM, 4 sound channels, twin cartridge sockets, as well as several built-in ROM software packages like <b>View<\/b> (word processor), <b>ViewSheet<\/b> (spreadsheet), <b>ADFS<\/b> (Advanced Filing System), a text editor and terminal utilities.\n \nLike the Model B, the system had so many I\/O ports that most of them had to be placed under the case. Luckily, they only used flat-cable connectors. \nWhen it was released, the BBC Master met with great success. From 1986 to 1989, about 200,000 systems were sold, mainly to U.K. schools and universities. \nSeveral enhanced versions of the Master were launched in the following months:\n- The <b>Master 512<\/b> was a Master 128 with 512 KB of RAM and an internal 80186 processor. It could be upgraded up to 1024 KB and ran MS-DOS.\n- The <b>Master Turbo<\/b> was a Master 128 with a 65C02 as a second processor.\nThe BBC Master and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=729\">Master Compact<\/a> could be considered the most accomplished 8-bit 'home' computers and among the last mass-produced 8-bit machines. Production ended in 1993.\n \nWhile developing and marketing the BBC Master, Acorn realized the PC world was moving on from 8-bit to 16-bit processors and started developing their own 32-bit chip, the Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM.",

This computer was meant to be (somewhat) portable, so you could take it with you when you visited your friends. On the underside is a compartment that looks like a battery-compartment, but is used to store the power-cable when you are transporting the computer.\nFor the rest it's simply a 64KB MSX computer like the rest of them.

An eight connector backplane supporting logic boards. However, the CPU board featured a 16 bit 8086-2 and up to 1 MB of RAM could be installed.\nThre models were available:\n<b>Model 19<\/b> with 256 KB RAM and 2 x 5\" 800 KB floppy drive,\n<b>Model 39<\/b> with 512 KB of RAM, one floppy drive and one 10 MB hard disk,\n<b>Model 49<\/b> same as Model 39 but with a 20 MB hard disk.\nThe Quattro could work with wirtually any video terminal. ICL supplied its own monochrome (6402G) and colour (6404G) graphic versions along with a 102 key keyboard.\nIt was delivered with Concurrent CP\/M Operating System, later called Concurrent DOS, a true multi-tasking, multi-user O.S. which offered a very limited compatibility with MS-DOS.\nSadly, few major software of the time, running on the first IBM PC and clones, were adapted to the specific features of the ICL. This is the main reason why the Quattro didn't meet any success, except near some corporate customers who already used ICL mainframes.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=852\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

Several programs were bundled with the system, they allowed pictures, graphs ot texts to be mixed with any video source.\nAnother interesting aspect of the HC-95 hardware was it's double prrocessor feature. User could select between the usual Z80A\/3.5 MHz processor and a custom JVC processor called HD64180, running at 6 MHz.\nJVC tried to sell its HC-95 in Europe with no success, probably because of the Commodore <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a> competition.

For example, it could not being used in the rain.\nThe chicklet keyboard featured a numeric and arrow key keypad. However, Husky could produce 'cut down' versions dedicated to particular applications.\nSeveral peripheral could be connected to the Hawk.\nThe <b>Sidebox<\/b> was designed to be used on the move and was powered by Hawk's internal batteries. It was firmly locked to the Bus expansion and accepted a portable 1200 baud modem, an analogue to digital converter, RAM and ROM disk expansions and a Parallel interface.\nThe '<b>Homebase<\/b>' expansion required a mains supply and automatically connected the Hawk to a 2400 baud modem and charger whenever it was placed on it. \nA 3.5\" disc drive unit called Oracle (made in Japan by Brother) and a bar-code reader also could be connected to the mini-DIN serial port.\nThe DEMOS operating system (for <b>D<\/b>isk <b>EM<\/b>ulation <b>O<\/b>perating <b>S<\/b>ystem) was a very compatible extended version of CP\/M 2.2. All standard CP\/M software - WordStar, CalcStar, Mbasic... - ran without problems. To overcome standard CP\/M 80 column screen output, Husky used a  40 X 8 virtual window on a full size 80 x 25 screen. \nFor custom application writers, Husky also provided a special version of <b>Locomotive BASIC<\/b>, a superset of Microsoft BASIC, also well known of Amstrad users. This version took advantage of the special facilities of the Hawk: graphics handling, both serial and infra-red ports, bar-code reader and file management using physical or virtual RAM and ROM disks.",

Hundreds of games were produced for the system and it sold very well.\nIt had one of the most unique accessories too; R.O.B (Robotic Operating Buddy). It was controlled by flashes from the screen generated by the game itself. It couldn't do much except move around some discs from one platform to another. It was popular because it was something different.\nThe NES was home to some of the biggest franchises in video game history and there are still games being made based on characters first seen on the NES. Characters like Mario (who technically was first seen in the Arcades in Donkey-Kong game, though he was called then only \"jumpman\"), Samus (Metroid), and Link.\nOther companies like Sega (Master System) and Atari (Atari 7800) tried to get a piece of the pie with their own systems but neither of them were able to come anywhere near the sales figures of the Nintendo. There is no doubt that the NES was the most popular 8-bit gaming system.\nIn the early '90s Nintendo redesigned the NES. It was top-loading design and the controllers looked alot like SNES controller except with only 2 buttons. The Famicom (japanese version of the NES) had the longest production life of any console ever to this day from 1983 to 2004 in Japan. It shifted 60 million units in its life time!\nA bunch of accessories were available for the NES &amp; Famicom, including : lightgun, ROB the robot, disk drives, BASIC keyboard, dancing mat, power glove, additional controllers and much more...",

        "description": "The IBM RT (or PC\/RT or 6150 in Europe) was a 32-bit RISC machine. In fact 'RT' meant 'RISC Technology' where RISC itself was initials of <b>R<\/b>educed <b>I<\/b>nstruction <b>S<\/b>et <b>C<\/b>omputers. This machine was IBM's first try into the single-user workstation world and was the ancestor of the RS\/6000 range. \nThe advantages of RISC technology were smaller processor chips, since they needed less on-chip storage for the instruction set, faster signal transfer between devices, and faster instruction execution since the reduced set was designed so that most instructions was executed in a single clock cycle.\nThe RISC processor of the 6150 was called ROMP for <b>R<\/b>eshearch <b>O<\/b>ffice <b>P<\/b>roducts <b>D<\/b>ivision. Its study started in IBM Texas labs in 1977 and a prototype form ran in 1978\nThere were two RT models, the floor-standing 6150 and the desktop 6151. The differences between them lie in the positioning of some I\/O ports and in the storage options available.\nDespite processor incompatibility with MS-DOS software, the 6150 could run PC software thanks to a PC expansion card holding a Intel 80286 and designed to fit in one of the AT compatible slots of the 6150. the motherboard featured four 32-bit expansion slots to hold the ROMP board, an optional floating-point accelerator board, and two 2 MB RAM boards; two 8-bit and six 16-bit PC slots.\nThe 6150 operating system was called AIX for <b>A<\/b>dvanced <b>I<\/b>nteractive e<b>X<\/b>ecutive. It succeded to IBM OSes. In fact, it was just an Unix System V with Berkeley 4.2 enhancements and IBM adds for the 6150 environment. Among these adds, the VRM (<b>V<\/b>irtual <b>R<\/b>essource <b>M<\/b>anager) handled the interface between the Unix kernel and the specific 6150 harware it ran on. A DOS shell was also provided for MS-DOS applications. \nNowadays, one finds RISC processors mainly in numerous small devices like PalmTops or mobile phones. Apple and IBM also use them today, the biggest examples being the PowerPC 7455 (G4) and PowerPC G5 Processor, mostly used in the Power Macintosh and Powerbook series of computers. Many Proprietary Unix systems used them up until only a few years ago (Sun, Silicon Graphics).\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=867\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Thomson MO5 NR is a special version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=12\">MO5<\/a>, developped especially for the educative network called NanoReseau, hence the \"NR\". The NanoR?seau was initially composed of several original MO5 systems with their NanoR?seau expansions (64 KB RAM + Network features). The MO5 NR includes the network expansion and much more.\nThe system uses the same case as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=838\">MO5E<\/a>, but the MO5 NR is maybe closer to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=167\">MO6<\/a> than to the original <a href=\"computer.asp?c=12\">MO5<\/a>. It is the first \"MO\" system to offer a boot menu, later found on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=167\">MO6<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=238\">T08<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=238\">TO8D<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=239\">TO9<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=240\">TO9+<\/a>. This feature is closely related to the fact that these systems hold two Basic languages: the Microsoft Basic 1.0 (in fact level 5) initially found on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=11\">TO-7<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=643\">TO-7\/70<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=12\">MO5<\/a>; and the Basic Microsoft 128 offering among other things, full 128 KB RAM to work with, which is quite a tour de force as most 8-bit systems of the time couldn't handle more than 64 KB RAM.\nThe MO5 NR also offer a palette of 4096 colours to choose from, though only 16 could be displayed at the same time on the screen. Graphic resolutions come from 160 x 200 to 640 x 200, though the most used was 320 x 200. There is the possibility to display 80 and 40 text columns.\nLike on the MO5E, two controller ports (Atari standard) can be found at the front of the system. In fact the MO5 expansion called \"music &amp; games\" is also built-in and offer these two controller ports and 4 voices with 5 octaves. But at the back is where you can tell the difference! Compared to the MO5E, the SCART connector has been replaced by two Network DIN connectors, the RF TV video output by the power in plug, the Centronics interface by Network dip switches (for network station numbering, the same found on the Network expansion of the original MO5), and the power cord (MO5E had a built-in power supply) by a SCART cord... quite different indeed (see MORE PICTURES section). Thus the MO5NR need to be powered by an external power supply. The MO5 PSU can be used, but in schools, the MO5 NR was generaly powered by its own dedicated monitor.\nThe MO5NR is thus a kind of super MO5, a mix between the MO5 and the soon to be released MO6. Unfortunately, as it was very expensive, schools prefered to buy MO5E systems with a network expansion...",

The system featured an 8 MHz processor and a 10 MB hard disk in a package 30% smaller and 20% lighter than previous PC model.\nThe general engineering idea behind this machine was to provide a cut-down IBM PC\/AT clone with fewer expansion slots (5), a small hard disk and a floppy disc. This allowed Compaq to make the Portable II smaller and lighter without sacrificing too much specification.\nLike many portable systems of the time, the keyboard attached to the front of the case and when the machine was ready for carrying, it was like a sewing machine. \nThe machine was supplied with 640 KB of RAM which was the maximum that could be fitted to the main board. However, RAM could be taken up to 2.1 MB by using a custom-designed expansion card.\nTechnically the Portable II gave its user more power than an IBM PC\/AT for almost half the price.\nAt the same time, Compaq delivered two desktop computers, the Deskpro PC\/XT and Deskpro PC\/AT, and two portable systems, the Portable\/Plus PC\/XT and the Portable 286 which was a full function PC\/AT clone.",

Like the ICL version, the Tonto was sold only in the U.K. It was born thanks to a collaborative venture between British Telecom, ICL and Sinclair Research. The designers idea was to build a centralized desktop information system able to access online services, mainframes and other similar systems through the British Telecom network.\nIt was essentially a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=199\">Sinclair QL<\/a> at heart, featuring the same 68008 processor. Applications software were stored in plug-in ROM cartridges or Microdrive tapes. Sadly, both of them were not compatible with QL interfaces and microdrives format and the specific Tonto O.S. couldn't run ordinary software made for the QL, even in BASIC language.\nHowever, the most interesting aspect of the Tonto was its telephony integration. Its internal modem (300 an 1200\/75 baud) could manage two telephone lines, and the Tonto, could be used as an intelligent answering machine thanks to its synthesised voice response (but no record capabilities), a Prestel terminal for Videotext services as well as a specialized peripheral and multi-protocols terminal for mainframes. Several interconnected Tonto's also could automatically exchange files and information between them.\nBelow are prices for the Tonto at is launch, taken from a BT promotional video for the Tonto, dated 29-4-1985.\n?1245  Basic Mono Machine\n?1375  Basic Mono Machine with Xchange\n?1675  Colour Machine\n?1805  Colour Machine with Xchange\nThese are all Excluding VAT.\nSo these are the final prices.\n?1462  Basic Mono Machine\n?1615  Basic Mono Machine with Xchange\n?1968  Colour Machine\n?2120  Colour Machine with Xchange\nThen you had an optional printer and many optional ROM packs.

        "description": "As early as 1974, Atari started to design a home version of PONG, originally proposed by Harold Lee in 1973. The system was designed by three engineers: Harold Lee, Alan Alcorn and Bob Brown.\nBecause Magnavox Odyssey was already being left behind by customers (mostly due to their lack of satisfaction, and also the bad rumor that it would only work with a Magnavox TV set), sellers were not attracted by Atari's PONG game until Sears goes ahead and sells the system under their Tele-Games label for Christmas 1975. Following this huge success, Atari released its own version of PONG in 1976.\nThe system had an important feature that most others didn't have in 1975: the use of a single chip that provided games with digital on-screen scoring and attractive sound. As a matter of fact, other systems were still using analog or digital circuits using discrete components. Digial on-screen scoring would have required more components in the circuits, hence an increase of the retail price. Because Atari designed a special PONG chip, the system could sell at normal price with advanced features.\nIn 1975, Atari was rejected by toys and electronics manufacturers as most other PONG systems didn't sell much. One of Atari's directors decided to contact Tom Quinn, who worked at Sears\/Roebuck. After several meetings with Bushnell, Sears ordered 150,000 PONG systems for Christmas. Assembled by Atari, the system sold under the Sears Tele-Games label (<a href=\"computer.asp?st=3&amp;c=873\">Pong model 25796<\/a>). Some people still remember Christmas 1975 when they were going to the shops early in the morning and wait several hours to sign a list allowing them to receive a PONG system.\nPong will be a huge success, and will be the cause of multiple imitations and several law suits. However, its popularity did not fall until more advanced systems came on the market.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n_________\n<b>Source : <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">PONG-STORY.COM<\/a><\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=872\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Before the Challenger came out, Gemini products were based around the Z80 processor and the company's 80-bus architecture. They did well in applications where costumers wanted a highly-specialized product.\nAt first sight, the Challenger looked like an ordinary PC-compatible computer. The monitor  was a <b>Wyse WY-50<\/b> remote terminal finished as the same colours as the main box. However, the Challenger's main processor was a 12 MHz Motorola  68000 linked with 512 KB of RAM. This configuration made the Challenger a very high speed 16-bit system for the time.\nWhile designing the Challenger, Gemini designers also created a new 68000 proprietary bus called <b>68K<\/b>, which was originally a 16-bit bus but was later extended to 32-bit when the 68020 became available. Four 68K slots were available on the Challenger mainboard. They also designed an impressive graphic card based on the Hitachi HD63484 graphic processor and consisting in two piggy-back full length cards plugged into a 68K slot. Maximum resolution was 1024 x 1024 pixels with  16 million available colours. \nThe Challenger was delivered with a wide range of operating systems:\n- <b>MBOS<\/b> a business-based multi-user O.S.,\n- <b>Mirage<\/b> Another multi-user O.S. but more esoteric,\n- <b>TDI p-System<\/b>, the British version of UCSD p-System well known for its UCSD Pascal language,\n- <b>CP\/M 68k<\/b>, the 68000 version of the 8-bit O.S. which was never very popular.\nEach of these O.S. could cohabit into several partitions of a same hard disk.\nDespite it's advanced features, the Challenger never met success, neither as a businness machine as very few software were developped for it, nor as a development system as the 68K bus never was carried by other manufacturers.\nThe last machine made by Gemini was a beautifully built IBM clone using a motherboard designed by British Aerospace. But it was too expensive and couldn't compete against far east production. Gemini finally disappeared about one year after the Challenger was launched.",

        "description": "On December 1975, the coveted inside-front-cover of Byte magazine contained a two-page advertisement for \"the world's lowest cost computer system\". This was perhaps the first non-MOS Technology 6502 based computer system to come to market, behind only the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=747\">TIM<\/a> and possibly <a href=\"computer.asp?c=149\">KIM-1<\/a>. The computer was named Jolt, and it was marketed by Microcomputer Associates Inc. as both a kit for $249, or fully assembled and tested for $348 (Dec. 1975 Byte).\nMicrocomputer Associates also sold add-ons for the basic system. They included 4 kilobytes for $265, an I\/O card for $96, and a power supply for $145.\nThe Jolt is somewhat famous for the part it played in the development of the prototype Atari 2600 VCS, which was assembled using the Jolt computer board.\nJolt was designed and developed by <b>Raymond M. Holt<\/b>, Founder and Executive Vice-President of Microcomputer Associates. Holt went on to design the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=856\">SYM-1<\/a> single-board computer, a KIM-1 clone. In the late 1990's Holt was finally given government permission to discuss his role in the development of the F-14 Tomcat. Holt claims he designed and developed the worlds first microprocessor one year before Intel.\n<b>Manny Lemas<\/b> was the co-founder of Microcomputer Associates, Inc. Ray Holt was the hardware side and he was the software side of the business. He wrote the <b>DEMON<\/b> (Debugger\/Monitor) software for the JOLT.\nThis software was actually developed for MOS Technology for use in the\nTIM chip and the KIM-1 single board computer.

        "description": "The year 1993 saw Amstrad release a handheld computer capable of handwriting recognition just weeks ahead of Apple's much-hyped Newton. However, Amstrad's approach with the <b>PDA600<\/b> was very much more primitive with users only able to input one letter at a time in a box at the bottom of the screen. \nThe device was based on a Z80 compatible Zilog Z8S180 microprocessor running at 14.3MHz and memory was expandable from 128KB up to 2MB with PCMCIA cards. Batteries life was 40 hours, from three 'AA' size batteries and the device weighed just 400 grams. \nOther features included  a search function, world time clock with multiple alarms, information transfer capability to and from PCs, metric-imperial conversion and the ability to input drawings.\nBut despite being less than half the price of Apple's more advanced machine ? $430 compared to $920 - the PDA600 bombed, although it does seem to have been popular in Germany, for some reason. \nCliff Lawson, PDA600 project manager, writes on his <a href=\"http:\/\/web.ukonline.co.uk\/cliff.lawson\/penpad.htm\">web site<\/a>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe PDA600 is one of my favourite Amstrad projects which probably has something to do with the fact that I was the Project Manager!\nUnfortunately, The whole PDA concept was a bit of a plot that failed and as we were left with huge stocks of the PDA600 we have recently [c1996] sold them all to Tandy (Radio Shack). This does have the huge advantage that you can now buy one for ?50 (which is less than half what it cost us to build them!)\n...\nInteresting fact number 37 is that we got about 95% of the way through developing a replacement for the PDA600 called the PIC700 that included a radio pager but it ran hugely over budget and schedule and was eventually shelved ... shame, it was brilliant.\"\n<\/font>\nThose that actually spent money on the PDA600 were less enthusiastic.\nMark Stevenson () says on his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.markstevenson.nildram.co.uk\/com\/comppda600.htm\">page<\/a>: \n<font color=\"#666666\">\nWhat can I say about the PDA600? This must be in my opinion the worst computer ever! It was supposed to be able to convert handwriting to text to allow quick and easy entries to be made, but it could never read my writing so I was forever going back to correct my mistakes.\nThe machine was also short on memory, it came as standard with 128kb. This could be filled with around 20 free form notes without any database entries being made at all.\nThe database was completely uncustomisable, being suitable really only for a phone book. It also had a diary function which I don't think was too bad - if you could ever get the entry in with the handwriting recognition.\nThanks to <b>Alan Sampson<\/b> and <b>Graeme Burton<\/b> <\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=876\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was a true 16-bit laptop computer conceived by John Zepecki, Gaviland's director of hardware engineering. It featured a 8-line LCD screen and was powered by either an AC adaptor or 10 half-D rechargeable batteries with 8 hours autonomy.\nThe 48 KB ROM held the Gavilan <b>GOS<\/b> (Graphic Operating System) kernel, a FORTH-like interpreter and a desktop manager software with graphic windows, drawers, folders and documents hierarchy.\nThe Operating System itself was written in Forth and supervised by John Banning, chief of the Gaviland's software development team. Most of the graphical environment was managed through an innovative touch panel located above the keyboard and intended to compete with first mouse driven systems. By moving his fingertip across this panel, the user moved a pointer and could invoke various actions by tapping one of the eight button areas.\nGavilan developed several software that took advantage of the GOS interface, a word processor, a spreadsheet, communication and mail utilities. The system could run MS-DOS OS as well.\nDespite numerous innovations, the Gavilan always suffered from hardware and software problems. Furthermore, it was not fully PC-compatible. Many changes have been made to the initial machine and first sales only started in June of 1984, one year after the machine was first announced. A 16-line display version was also produced. At this time, competiton became harder and the Gavilan couldn't compete with new Japanese portable generation (i.e. the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=476\">Sharp PC-5000<\/a>). The Gavilan production thus stopped definitively in 1985 and the company failed.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=877\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "A new generation of games was born in the summer of 1977, a new concept revolutionizing leisure will let small leading and foreseeing companies make billions of dollars. \nAlthough the Atari VCS is not the first video game console ever, it will become a star while beginning in November of 1977. Millions of young players will hold it as mankind?s best invention ever. The first console idea was developed in 1975 by Atari and Warner Bros, its parent company. \nInitially the console was set to come with an integrated ROM game, but at the last minute, Atari preferred a cartridge version. This game was ?Combat?. Most importantly, this first cartridge will allow console owners to wait a few months for the release of new games. A first series of 8 will be followed later by many, among them, the famous ?Space Invaders?, a title giving Atari global success and will cash in more then $100 millions. \nIn two years, Atari sold more than 25 million consoles and earn $5 billion in sales, mostly from cartridges and optional accessories. Many third companies will also encounter success, such as Namco and its ?Pacman?. \nIn 1982, the VCS becomes ?2600? until Atari is sold in 1984, followed by new versions ?5200? and ?7800?. However, the 2600 continued to be produced and new games will appear until 1991. The VCS\/2600 console thus lived for 14 years, a record longevity never equaled since by any console or computer.\n________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Bluekatt<\/b> (from Netherlands) comments:\nthe atari's record has already been broken twice ( to a degree ) first by the nintendo famicom who went into production in japan in 1983 and went out of it in 2004 thats 21 years the other is the gameboy who has been running ever since 1989 in one form or another honorable mention is the playstation 1 who has also survived for 12 years one way or another for around 6 7 years as a hardware entity andnow as a integrated romchip and emulator calls in the ps 2 and 3<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=878\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

Each GI chips was able to generate several games, ball games for a start, then later car racing, motorcycle, submarines, tanks and shooting games.\nThe system has two detachable controllers with one analog joystick and one fire button each. The control panel is composed of 10 buttons to select the different games offered by each cartridge (10 being the maximum). Difficulty switches, power switch and a start button can also be found.\nThe Tank Battle game produced by the AY-3-8710 chip from General Instruments, is often missing from available cartridges for this type of systems (based upon GI chips). There is one good reason. All the other games use analog controllers whereas the Tank Battle must be played with digital controllers (like direction buttons for example). And all these video-game systems were designed with analog controllers and no numeric ones. However, some systems, like the SHG Blackpoint FS-1003 offered optional digital controllers (pads with 5 buttons: directions and fire) with the Tank Battle cartridge...\nThe SHG Black Point is quite confusing because there are different models with the same name, though they are both compatible with each other. In fact one is the Model FS-1003 (presented here), and the other one is the Model FS-2000.",

        "description": "LX-500 series were first microcomputers from Logabax, a French computers manufacturer specialized in small and medium size computers aimed at private and state-owned companies.\nIt was a stange looking small metal box containing a single multifunction Z80 based card and two 90 KB 5.25\" floppy drives. A serial port allowed the Logabax video terminal to be connected. A few months later, several versions appeared (LX-525, LX-528) featuring a cheap plastic case, but 710 KB floppy drives and two extra Serial ports. The system ran Logabax DOS and a flavour of CP\/M Operating System.\nIn fact, due to its very expensive price for the time (about 4000 Euros) the LX-500 never met success near private companies despite Logabax efforts in setting up an European dealers network.\nHowever, at this time French ministry of education sought french computers to equip thousands of high schools. Only two French manufacturers were able to provide such small systems: R2E (with its <a href=\"computer.asp?c=869\">80-20<\/a> series) and Logabax. Thus Logabax got more than half the ministry contract and several thousands systems were installed in classrooms, even though the system was far to meet reliability and ease of use requested in educational environment.\nThe LX-500 was one of the first machines with which French students could learn LSE language (Symbolic Language for Education), a structured evolution of the BASIC language, with French keywords, intended to be the universal language for students and academics. However, student liked PASCAL and Microsoft BASIC better than LSE, and the language quickly sank into oblivion.\nDespite Logabax had priviligied access to procurement contracts with French state, the company met serious cash shortage problems. After several vain attempts from French government to refloat the company, Logabax was eventually sold to Olivetti, the first Italian computers company. After some common ventures (Olivetti-Logabax <a href=\"computer.asp?c=154\">Persona PC<\/a> systems), Logabax finally disappeared for good.",

        "description": "The Magnavox Odyssey was the first home video game system, invented by Ralph Baer, who started work on it as early as 1967. It was then launched in 1972 at the end of which over 100,000 units were sold.\nThis system is very basic, having no CPU, score mechanism, colour or sound. In fact there were only 40 diodes and 40 transistors inside. Six cartridges could be used to play up to 12 games - sometimes the same cartridges being used more than once to play different games. The large number of game accessories that came with it allowed for different games to be played, with some games using the accessories as a main focus for the game instead of the console. Each game used a plastic transparent colour overlay which was to affixed to the TV set. The overlays compensated for the fact that the Odyssey could only produce a vertical line, a dot for the ball and 2 shorter lines (representing each player controller) on the screen. The overlays were meant to attach to the TV by use of static electricity and smoothed over by hand or a soft cloth, but the instruction manual said if this didn?t work one should use tape instead. It even suggested that you could trim them down to fit your TV set!\nThe controllers are in fact two largish block sized controllers with a round dial on either side. Twisting the dial on the left for horizontal movement, and the right for vertical movement. An `English? dial on the left of each one controlled the `deflection ? of the ball. Ball speed could also be controlled.\nDespite the basic nature of the games by today's standards, the system marked a crucial change in the way people used their TVs. In 1972 the marketing stated that the user could now actually `participate? in television and not just be a spectator, with the system manual describing it as: `<font color=\"#666666\">The exciting casino action of Monte Carlo, the thrills of Wimbledon, the challenge of ski trails ? can be duplicated right in your own living room.<\/font>? \nThe games included tennis, ski, hockey, table tennis, simon says, analogic, states, cat and mouse, submarine, football, haunted house, roulette, invasion and shooting games (with the optional rifle that could be purchased separately). Most games were also played with cards, dices, paper money or game chips delivered with the system.\nOdyssey?s cartridges contain no components: they are basically wirejumper sets. When plugging a cartridge into the console, internal diode logic circuits are interconnected in different ways to produce the desired result. As a matter of fact, the Odyssey contains everything to make a game based around a ball, one or two paddles representing the players, and a central or off-side vertical line which serves as a net or a wall. The cartridges act to connect some the machine?s diode logic circuitry to set the aspect and the position of the vertical line (normally centered for ping pong and tennis but located on the left or on the middle for handball and volleyball respectively, or not displayed at all for Chase games and gun games), and to determine the interaction between the ball and the other graphic objects: bounce or erase either a player or a ball spot when there is a collision with a player or the central line (a player could even be erased after a collision with the ball).\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text and info from Abi Waddell &amp; David Winter.<\/font>",

        "description": "The National Radio Institute 832 was probably the first commercially available computer kit. It was sold as part of a correspondence computer course.\nWe don't know much about this machine, but <b>Jason Anderson<\/b>, the proud owner of the pictured machine sent us a letter from <b>Lou Frenzel<\/b>, the designer of the NRI-832:\n<font color=\"3666666\">\nI did design the 832 back in 1970-71 time period.\nIt was part of a home study course on computers offered by National Radio Institute, a school owned by publisher McGraw Hill.  It was delivered as a series of kits, 5 if I remember correctly. \nThe memory was a diode switch matrix with 16 bytes programmable with slide switches.  It also had an additional 16 bytes of TTL SRAM which was very expensive at the time.  It was made with  TTL digital logic which was very expensive, but I couldn't bring myself to use any of the older but cheaper RTL or DTL chips.\nAll processing was done serially with a total of 8 instructions.  Amazingly, you could program almost anything if you could get it into the limited memory. This turned out to be a very popular course and kit surprising all of us at the time.  We packaged the kits ourselves.\nNRI went out of business in 1999 but McGraw Hill is still around, but I imagine\nall that 832 stuff is long gone.\nI had been hauling around a fully wired 832 for years and even offered it to the Boston Computer Museum as an example of early computer kits but it was rejected.  I eventually threw it away after it suffered damage during hurricane Andrew in Florida in 1994.  I think I still have one of the memory boards and a set of manuals somewhere in my storage unit.  Haven't seen them for years. \n<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=884\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Schneider CPC-464 was produced in Germany by Schneider Rundfunkwerke. It was first marketed successfully in Germany, then in France and Spain and maybe other European countries. \nIt was basically the same machine as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=84\">Amstrad CPC-64<\/a> with a less colorful case and keyboard and some slight hardware differences, like better quality back connectors. \n\nMore information about the Schneider-CPC range by <b>Lyall Moffitt<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThis document lists the differences between the English CPC's and the German CPC's.\n \nThe original distributor in Germany was Schneider GmbH. The machines distributed by Schneider had the Schneider logo on them. (The monitors and some peripherals were also re-branded as \"Schneider\" e.g. Schneider DDI-1). Later CPCs were distributed by Amstrad and had the Amstrad logo on them.\nThe three models distributed by Schneider were:\n \n<b>Schneider CPC464:<\/b>\n \nThis had the Schneider logo followed by \"64k Colour Personal Computer &gt;\" printed on the keyboard.\nThe keyboard did not have green and red keys, instead these were coloured light brown\/grey.\n \n<b>Schneider CPC664:<\/b>\n \nThis had the Schneider logo followed by \"64k Colour Personal Computer &gt;\" printed on the keyboard.\n \nThe keyboard did not have blue keys, instead these were coloured light brown\/grey.\n \n<b>Schneider CPC6128:<\/b>\n \nThis had the Schneider logo followed by \"CPC6128: schneiderCPC\" printed on the keyboard.\n \nEarly German CPC's show \"Schneider 64K Microcomputer ...\" or \"Schneider 128K microcomputer ...\" on start-up. Later CPC's showed \"Amstrad 64k Microcomputer ...\" or \"Amstrad 128K microcomputer ...\". The start-up name is defined by option links on the P.C.B. \nGerman CPC464's and CPC664's have P.C.B. edge connectors like the English CPC's.\n \nGerman CPC6128's have real connectors, instead of the P.C.B. edge of the English CPC's. This was done to reduce RF emissions. The printer is a 36-way female centronics type, the Expansion is a 50-way female centronics type and the second disc drive is a 34-way female centronics type. All the other connectors are the same. (joystick, stereo sound, monitor and power). \nAll German CPC's have internal metal shield covering the circuit board. This is used to reduce RF emissions. Therefore the German CPC's are much heavier than the English CPC's.\n \nInternally, all German CPC's were identical to the English CPC's. The P.C.B. was identical.\n \nThe quick reference \"sheet\" on the top of the CPC6128 and CPC664 disc drive is also in German.\n \nThe computer information, printed on the base of the computer is also in German. \n<\/font>",

All other features were the same as the Compaq.\nWhen the system was launched, the main argument of Columbia was the large number of software bundled with it. Among them: MS-DOS, CP\/M-86, Perfect series (Writer, Filer, Speller, Calc), MS-BASIC, Macro assembler, Home accountant and Space Commander game.\nIt seems that several versions of the VP were built: 1600\/1, 1600\/4, 2110, 2220, VP-Plus, but we have no information about them.",

        "description": "The Channel F was the first programmable video game system, having plug-in cartridges containing ROM and microprocessor code rather than dedicated circuits. Not a very popular or entertaining system, it was nonetheless important at the time for having a number of original features which were copied by later more successful systems. \nUnique to the console is a `hold' button that allowed the player freeze the game and also change either the time, the speed or both during the course of the game, without altering the score.  Another feature which was used for the Hockey game was `overtime' which allowed one minute of extra play should there be a tie-break in the score.\nDetached controllers were just starting to appear on `pong' units as opposed to having them directly on the unit itself.  The Channel F controllers which were attached to the unit with dedicated wires, were gripped by the whole hand and enabled movement in all directions, including the twisting left and right for `paddle' movement. There was no firebutton, the joystick had 8 way digital movement, forward\/backwards, left\/right, pull knob down\/pull up and twist counter-\/clockwise. \nFairchild released twenty-six different cartridges for the system, with up to four games being on each cartridge. The games included sports, such as Hockey, Tennis and Baseball, educational, such as Maths Quiz, board games, such as Checkers, and shooting games, such as Space War. The cartridges had labels that contained the game instructions on them and each were given a sequential number. In this respect Fairchild started a trend in trying to boost game sales by numbering them and so appealing to consumers who wanted to complete their collection.\nThe Channel F console's popularity lowered when the Atari released their <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">VCS<\/a> in 1977 as the VCS had much better graphics, games and sound. Fairchild responded to the Atari VCS by changing the name of their console to the `Fairchild Channel F' from it's original name of the `Fairchild Video Entertainment System', but this did not raise flagging sales.\nIn 1978, Zircon International Inc. bought the rights for the Channel F and released it as the Channel F System 2. This new system had some minor modifications : slightly different cosmetic design, sound output through TV speakers and the controller holders at the back of the unit. But this new model did not succeed either, as this time, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari VCS<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Intellivision<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=695\">Odyssey?<\/a> were already on the market...\nIn Sweden this console was sold as the Luxor Video Entertainment System.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Abi Waddell, Fredric CJ Blaholtz, Bj?rn Roman<\/font>",

        "description": "Convergent Technologies of Santa Clara, California introduced the Worslate the same time as the Tandy <a href=\"computer.asp?c=233\">Model 100<\/a>. Although it was about the same size of the Model 100, the Workslate was primarily a spreadsheet machine. No other software could be loaded except some application which was adaptations of the basic spreadsheet program.\nThe Workslate used a CMOS version of the old 6800 processor and 16B KB of RAM. RAM size couldn't be extended and allowed a limited 720 cells spreadsheet to be filled. The keyboard with circular rubber-keys was hard-to-use for text entry. However, with its phone book, memo pad, and financial calculator, the Workslate was designed for those who only wanted a business tool and didn't want to learn about computers.\nAlso built-in were a tape drive able to record and play data's or voice annotations, a 300-baud modem and a printer port.\nThe Workslate was first launched in the American Express Christmas catalog, and was sold as a high-tech novelty product. But no one was interested in buying a limited spredsheet machine for $895. Convergent Technology planned to sell 200,000 units within a year, but only 5,000 systems were sold in the U.S.A plus some hundreds in Europe. The product was discontinued in July 1984, and the company lost about $15 million. \nIf you notice the keyboard has a \"DoIt\" key. The President of the fledgling company Allen Michaels used to roam the halls of the company at night and spray paint \"DoIT\" everywhere, hence the key name.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>John Demian<\/b> from Modesto, California had the good luck to find a complete Workslate system and sent us the Convergent references for all the peripherals and Taskware he found:\nWorkSlate # WK-100\nMicroPrinter # WP-100\nComm Port # WC-100 (has a Parallel and Serial interface for external printers.)\nTeach Me Now Tape # TW-120\nWorkSlate Reference Guide # 09-00279-01 - 11\/83\nTravel # 09-00385-00 - 11\/83\nLoan Analysis # 09-00387-00 - 11\/83\nPortfolio Analysis # 09-00388-00 - 11\/83\nFinancial Statements # 09-00390-00 - 11\/83\nCash Management # 09-00391-00 - 11\/83\nReal Estate # 09-00729-01 - 3\/84\nElectronic Information Services # 09-00735-01 - 3\/84<\/font>\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> John Demian, Ken Wood<\/font>",

        "description": "The Altair 680 appeared about one year after the successful <a href=\"computer.asp?c=62\">Altair 8800<\/a> was launched. With this model, MITS attempted to offer a new system based on the well known Motorola 6800 processor and then cover a large market share in small computer business.\nThe computer was available in kit or assembled form, It was smaller than the 8800 but kept the same design of front panel and switches. It featured 1 KB of RAM (4 times the 8800 RAM) and 1 KB of ROM with support for a serial terminal and punch tape reader.\nFor $420, customer got an assembled system with no display and no mass storage devices. program had to be entered each time the system was switched on using binary address and data switches. At power off, all of the RAM content was definitly lost. In fact, in order to get a really usable system with terminal or Teletype and tape or floppy disc storage, user had to invest about $2000, a fortune at the time.\nFirst available programming language was the BASIC 2.0 the young Micro-Soft company ported from the Intel 8080 to the 6800.\nAs the Altair 680 wasn't the first and cheaper 6800 based system, it didn't meet a great success. It was followed by the <b>680B<\/b> and the <b>680B Turnkey<\/b> where all front panel switches were replaced with an unique power key.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=892\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Atari 7800 ProSystem was originally scheduled for release in late 1984, as the follow-up to Atari?s misguided 5200 SuperSystem, but didn?t see release until 1986, when it retailed for approximately $140 (USA). Instead of competing with comparatively weaker systems like the 5200 and Coleco?s ColecoVision, the later release date for the 7800 brought direct competition from the more robust Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in late 1985, and the Sega Master System (SMS), which, like the ProSystem, was released in 1986.\nIn late 1984, despite having had successful showings at trade events, an extensive and enthusiastic preview in one of the top video and computer game magazines of the day (Electronic Games), retail orders already taken, and warehouses full of stock, Atari management decided to shelve the system and its launch games in favor of their computer line when it became apparent to them - and seemingly everyone else in the industry - that the videogame depression had become an irreversible crash. Also put on the shelf was a redesigned Atari 2600 (VCS), dubbed the Atari 2600jr, due to its diminutive size. These moves have often been criticized in hindsight, but for those around at the time, it was clear that videogames were being supplanted by low cost and powerful personal computers as the more flexible game machines of choice, and a game system in the traditional sense simply wouldn?t be financially sustainable.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=898\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

CW\/P aimed it firmly at the mainstream office Word Processor market.\nThe Cortex was in three main units, the keyboard, disc drive and display which housed the main logic board. The plastic housing was available in six vivid colours (some of them were not really restful on the eyes). Only four screws allowed to quickly change any part of the system.\nThe IBM-like keyboard was set up to generate various Wordstar control codes, and the version of WordStar shipped with it was modified to use them.\nIt was basically a CP\/M machine with some improvements: second processor for display management and graphics capabilities. It was also one of the first machines that GSX (Digital Research's graphics standard) was supported on.\nThe weird styling and high price relative to other CP\/M boxes didn't help it in the market. Furthermore, its 8-bit processor couldn't compete with the new wave of 16-bit professional computers, and the Cortex never met a large success although it was a nice, small-footprint machine.",

Atari chose to design the 5200 around technology used in their popular Atari <a href=\"computer.asp?c=76\">400<\/a>\/<a href=\"computer.asp?c=460\">800<\/a> 8-bit computer line, but was not directly compatible, unlike Atari?s much later pastel-colored XEGS (XE Game System) console.  The similarities in hardware did allow for relatively easy game conversions between the two systems, however, particularly when porting from the computer line to the 5200.\nThe Atari 5200, as designed, was more powerful than Mattel?s <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Intellivision<\/a> and roughly equivalent to Coleco?s <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=755\">ColecoVision<\/a>, both of which were the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">2600<\/a>?s main competition at the time and the systems Atari had to target in order to remain technologically competitive in the console marketplace.  Besides the unusually large size of the 5200 console, the controversial automatic RF switch box (incompatible with many televisions of the day without the included extra adapter) that also supplied power to the system and the innovation of four controller ports (the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=460\">Atari 800<\/a> computer also featured four controller ports), the most notable feature of the system was the inclusion of analog joysticks, which to the frustration of most gamers were fragile and did not self center, but had a keypad that accepted overlays and featured one of the first pause buttons.  Part of the 5200?s girth accommodated storage for these controllers to the rear of the console, as well as a wire wrap underneath.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text and info by Bill Loguidice<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=901\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "Commodore launched its range of PC-compatible systems at the height of the company?s  popularity, with home and business systems being sold in over 50 countries.  Commodore was the largest seller of computer systems in the world with sales in excess of $1 billion. Regardless, Commodore eventually suffered from permanent financial and structural problems. \nThe range of Commodore PC-compatible computers offered several different models:\n- <b>PC-1<\/b> A very small PC-compatible with a 4.77MHz 8088 processor (without turbo clock), a single 5.25? FDD, 512KB of RAM, and Hercules\/GCA video board.  The PC-1 lacked any internal expansion slots or cooling fans.\n- <b>PC-10<\/b> A basic 8088-based PC-compatible system with 1 or 2 floppy drives (page photo).\n- <b>Colt<\/b> A re-branded version of the PC-10 system.\n- <b>PC-20<\/b> Identical to the PC-10 system, but included a 20MB hard disk. \n- <b>PC-30<\/b> PC-AT 12 MHz 80286-based system including a 20MB hard disk. Probably the same machine as the PC-35 but only sold in Europe.\n- <b>PC-35<\/b> Same features as the PC-30.\n- <b>PC-40<\/b> PC-AT 10 MHz system with 1 MB RAM, Hercules\/CGA video card, and a 20MB to 80MB hard disk.  A jumper setting allowed the memory to be configured between 640KB or 512KB + 512KB of extended memory.\n- <b>PC-50<\/b> 80386SX 16 MHz system with a 40MB to 100MB hard disk.\n- <b>PC-60<\/b> 80386 25 MHz system with a tower case and a 60MB to 200MB hard disk. \nThe first Commodore PC-compatible was launched in early 1984, and the final systems left the German factory in 1993 ? one year before the company ceased operations\n___________\n<b>Maarten Jongkind<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">As an engineer back in the late 80s I installed, maintained and repaired commodore PC's. It was not a specific exciting or revolutionary computer but merely a good working IBM clone which evolved likewise. The PC10 however did gave me some strange problems due to the position of the double floppy drives, see the gap between them in the picture.\nOnce I recieved a strange complaint from a user, the computer was eating floppy's. they went in but never came out again.\nAfter a two hours drive I found that the user had inserted about 20 floppy's or more in the gap between the drives  ;-))<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=905\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

That is to say that the internal specs are exactly the same and that games would run on both systems. The cartridge slots are however different in shape and cartridges won't fit in each others. This group of consoles is often refered as \"<b>Interton VC-4000 compatible system<\/b>\" as the VC-4000 maybe the most popular of all the other systems (see <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">its entry<\/a> for more info).\nBut according to the excellent research work from Dale Hansen, the <b>1292 Advanced Programmable Video System<\/b> from Radofin would be the first member of the line as it was released in 1976! Radofin then licenced its system wordlwide to different companies.\nThere are two controllers composed of a 12 keys keypad, two red fire buttons and an analog joystick. Interton VC-4000 compatible systems usualy have these 12 keys and one or two fire buttons. The control panel has the same buttons found on all systems of this system family: Start, Load Programme, Game Select and on\/off switch.\nThere is also an <b>Acetronic MPU-2000<\/b>, which is almost the same system, only with slightly different case design and built-in power supply. The MPU-1000 Home Video Entertainment Center could also be found under different brands such as Radofin 1292, AudioSonic PP-1292, Radofin Programmierbares Video System or Hanimex HMG-1392. Or rather, the same hardware &amp; case were licenced (by Radofin?) to these different brands.\nOne particularity about this videogame \"family\" (VC-4000 &amp; clones), is that they seem to be the only systems which required the game to be loaded into internal RAM from the cartridge, before being able to play (generally through a LOAD PROGRAM or equivalent button found on the control panel).\nThe Acetronic MPU-1000 sold well in United-Kingdom and can be considered as the \"english Interton VC-4000\"...",

        "description": "The first Amiga 2500 model was released during 1989 and was most popular in the US and Canada, appealing to the high-end user and professional market. There was very little difference from previous revisions of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=63\">A2000<\/a>, the most notable being the addition of processor cards increasing the system speed.\nFirst models were sold with A2620 card (68020 processor + 68881 FPU), next with A2630 (68030 + 6882)\n<b>Armando Ruggeri<\/b>, from Canada, adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThis machine was sold in much greater numbers as the A2500HD which shipped with the much unliked A2090A ST506\/SCSI HD controller which later was replaced with the much better A2091 SCSI controller, typical sizes of the HDs were 40 - 80 Mb HD as I recall. The main reason to buy this machine was for the A2620 or 2630 accelerator cards that were plugged into the fast CPU slot. The 2620 included a 14Mhz clocked Motorola 68020 CPU, 68881 FPU and 68851 MMU.  It included 2Mb of 32bit Fast RAM expandable to 4Mb RAM if you were handy with a soldering iron and felt comfortable handling the uniquely packaged fragile ZIP (Zigzag Inline Package) chips! :)\nThis resulted in a 3X speed increase and much more if you had math intensive packages such as 3D graphics packages IE: Turbo Silver etc..\nLater onwards The A2620 was replaced with the faster A2630 which included a 25Mhz Motorola 68030 (With integrated MMU) and the much faster 68882 FPU, this combo could increase general speeds to 6X stock A2000 speeds. This board also shipped with 2Mb of 32 fast RAM or special ordered with 4Mb. Like the A2620 the 2Mb board could be upgraded by soldering in 16 ZIP chips, which usually was done by authorized service centers.\nThe two accelerator boards were both sold seperately for upgrading A2000\/A2000HDs to the identical A2500 speeds.  The price for these boards were extravegant at first with the first A2620 retailing in the $5000 Canadian dollars range on their release!\nLater on the boards became less popular as third party products from companies like GVP included faster performance, built in HD controler and much easier to expand memory systems.<\/font>\n<b>Paul Gable<\/b> specifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere was a board made by DKB called the 2632 which attached to the back of a 2630 and added up to 128 megs of RAM. This board is extremely rare.<\/font>",

Sound was entirely software driven as the hardware simply had a single digital output bit (Q) tied to an LED and also to the speaker.\nAn optional expansion board could be added, providing serial port (software driven), cassette interface (also software driven), 1 KB ROM monitor, optional 2K tiny basic, 4 KB RAM.  2 S-100 slots where additional static memory or a video board could be used. Along with a Super Monitor, there where two versions of pitman's tiny basic, one that used the 1861 video chip and another that used a 64 characters x16lines s-100 video board. \nThe cassette's output used the same 'Q' output used for audio on the main board, which meant that you heard all of your data as it was written out to cassette.\nThe 9 LEDs along the left side of the keypad indicate the state of the 'Q' output, the current operating mode (Load, Reset, Run, Wait) as well as the current state of the CPU (Fetch, Execute, DMA, Interrupt).\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=908\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

Basic versions had 16 KB of RAM as well as a joystick interface cabled in parallel with some keyboard keys. The BASIC interpreter also had some improvements and additional commands.\nThe CP-200 also had one very unique characteristic being that the video display was inverted (white on black instead of black on white for the ZX-81). Any key pressed on the keyboard generated a \"beep\" sound coming from the buzzer (his only function).\nThe bus connector wasn't strictly Sinclair compatible (pinout was different), but an adaptor card (?) allowed all Sinclair and third companies peripherals to be used with both CP-200 models.\nThe <b>CP-200s<\/b> was the same computer but with a redesigned motherboard in a new smaller (hence the \"s\"?) plastic case.

The company will later produce clones of a variety of other popular computers such as the Sinclair <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Spectrum<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> and even Tandy TRS-80 <a href=\"computer.asp?c=18\">Model III<\/a>. Actually, Microdigital never produced computers of its own design.\nHowever, the TK-82 wasn't a mere copy of the ZX-80 but featured several enhancements: two KB of RAM instead of one, a joystick interface, a tone generator and a dual tape transfer speed which could be either 300 or 4800 baud. \nThree models were successively launched. The <b>TK-82<\/b> with 4 KB of BASIC ROM, then the <b>TK-82S<\/b> with 8 KB of ROM, then the <b>TK-83<\/b> which RAM memory could be expanded up to 64 KB. First models used standard logic chips. They were later replaced by one custom chip, probably copied from the Sinclair ULA.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Dimitri Kokken<\/b> for the picture.\n\t\n<\/font>",

The company also supplied parts (transformers, fans...) to numerous computer factories in the world.\nThe CZ-2000 was a pure Sinclair <a href=\"computer.asp?c=223\">Spectrum<\/a> compatible system. The motherboard (Issue 4) was imported from Sinclair branch in Portugal. In Argentina Czerweny models competed with Brazilians TK 83, 85, 90x and genuine Sinclair machines, but CZ sold more machines than them.  \nThe color output was compatible with the local video standard (PAL-N), feature that the genuine Sinclair (PAL-B) and the Brazilians TK did not have. That was an advantage over these.\nEventhough in those times many people could not afford an extra color TV for the computer the difference was still important because a PAL-N signal produces a sharper\/clearer image on a B\/W TV than a NTSC or PAL B signal.\nThe computer got the legacy of an enomus ammount of available sofware for Spectrum in the country that was boosted before by the also popular <a href=\"computer.asp?c=634\">TIMEX 2068<\/a>\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>Dimitri Kokken<\/b> for the picture.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Atari 130 ST (ST means sixteen\/thirty-two :16 bit data bus &amp; 32 bit address bus) was shown at the Winter Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in 1985. It was the great surprise of the show and was presented only six months after Jack Tramiel bought Atari, Inc. (He later named it Atari Corp).\nThe ST series was rushed onto the market as Atari had originally contracted Amiga Corp. to manufacture a 16-Bit home computer, but legal issues caused the dissolution of that contract resulting in Commodore Computer releasing the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a> and Atari creating the ST using 'Off The Shelf' electronics to release a computer to coincide with Commodore's release of the Amiga.\nIt was also designed to be a \"<a href=\"computer.asp?c=271\">Macintosh<\/a> Killer\", and was jokingly called the \"Jackintosh\". It offered lots of features never found on home computers before: 16 bit microprocessor, lots of interfaces, standard MIDI interface, high graphic resolution, lot of colors, enhanced GUI (Graphic User Interface). It was much more powerful and expandable than the Macintosh (MIDI, graphics, colors, and the like) and competitors weren't very numerous (<a href=\"computer.asp?c=96\">Commodore 128<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=185\">PC AT<\/a>, &amp; compatibles, and the old CP\/M machines). That explains why more than 6 million of Atari ST's were sold around the world.\nThe Atari 130 ST was a prototype for the press demonstration and was never released because of its small memory size : the complete operating system couldn't fit in it. It was replaced by the <b>Atari 260 ST<\/b> and the <b>Atari 520 ST<\/b>. Despite its name, the Atari 260 ST was shipped with 512 KB of RAM,  because the 192 KB operating system left less than 64 KB of free RAM.\nThe Operating System was TOS (<b>T<\/b>ramiel <b>O<\/b>perating <b>S<\/b>ystem, later renamed just \"The Operating System\") which was in fact no more than the old CP\/M 68K. Notice that to make easy the transition from the PC to ST, all the high level calls of the TOS (called GEMDOS) were compatible with the DOS calls of the PC (int 21h).\nAll of the ST family systems used the GEM, which stands for Graphic Environment Manager, GUI (from Digital Research) which has a striking resemblance to the Macintosh GUI (windows, dialog boxes, desktop, desktop accessories, &amp; bitmap fonts) even if it is a bit less friendly than the Apple one.\nThe 260ST Operating System (TOS &amp; GEM) was supplied on disquette with earlier models, then into 6 x 32 KB ROM chips when the development of the O.S. was fully finished.\nST systems had several dedicated coprocessors for interrupt handling (MFP 68901), sound (the old Yamaha YM 2149, same as General Instruments AY-3-8910 found in <a href=\"computer.asp?c=90\">MSX computers<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=84\">Amstrad<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=180\">Oric<\/a>), video (a custom chip called \"Shifter\"), and memory (a custom chip called \"GLUE\" and the MMU).",

It was a logical development, keeping the same processor and clock speed, but with the following changes:\n \n? Basic language extended ie long variable names added, support for larger graphical display, total 48K in ROM.\n? Allows programs to address memory above 64K, through use of an extended memory controller.\n \n? HP-87 has 32K RAM built in, and allows up to 4 extra RAM modules of either 32K, 64K or 128K ie 534K max.\n \n? Built in HP-IB interface, together with software support for basic I\/O, mass-storage and printing without additional ROMs.\n \n? Bigger screen allowing 80 column text, with either 16 or 25 lines.\n \n? No built in tape or printer.\n \n? Support for multiple (up to 5) binary programs in RAM.\n \nThe HP-87 was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=140\">HP-86<\/a> and HP-87XM. The HP-86 lost the internal monitor in favour of an external monitor, and lost the built in HP-IB connector in favour of a Centronics parallel printer port and two connectors for HP floppy disks.\nThe HP-86 also had 64K RAM while the HP-87XM included 128K RAM. The final machine in the series 80 family was the <b>HP-86B<\/b>, which went back to having a built-in HP-IB port and featured 128K of RAM.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThanks to <b>John Shadbolt<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vintagecomputers.freeserve.co.uk\/index.htm\">site<\/a> for this information\n<\/font>",

        "description": "And now something for the ladies...\n<b>Torin Darkflight<\/b> kindly sent us following information and picture about this rather weird machine:\n\"This odd-looking and almost laughable computer was released by Honeywell\nunder the official name <b>H316 Pedestal<\/b> Model, but was featured on the cover of a Nieman-Marcus catalog under its more commonly-known name, the <b>\"Kitchen Computer\"<\/b>.\nThe Kitchen Computer is most likely where the classic recipe storage clich? originated, as this was the primary use advertised for the Kitchen Computer. In\nfact, storing recipes was about all the Kitchen Computer was capable of doing. The recipes were programmed into the computer and it would store them for you. In other words, it was an electronic recipe storage box, nothing more.\nSupposedly it was quite a chore to program recipes into the Kitchen Computer, mainly because it took about two weeks to learn how to program the thing. However, the Kitchen Computer was shipped with some recipes already programmed into it. Could this be the iMac of it's time? From box to dinner in only 10\nminutes? I doubt it, but we can imagine the pre-programmed recipes were included so anyone who purchased the Kitchen Computer could begin using it right away rather than having to suffer through learning how to program it first.\nWhen one thinks of computer hardware, they often think of a monitor or a keyboard or a printer. Well, the Kitchen Computer has perhaps the oddest piece of \"hardware\" I have ever heard of -- a cutting board. Yes, a cutting board! This oddity was most likely added so the food could be prepared right there\nwithout having to walk away from the recipe display, considering the Kitchen Computer isn't as portable as a good old-fashioned cookbook (It weighed a staggering 150 pounds).\nOther specifications for this system include 4KB magnetic core memory (Expandable to 16KB) and a system clock speed of 2.5MHz. I was not able to find any information about the display, but I imagine it has to be some kind of text display (Who'd want to read recipes using LEDs and binary code?). I also could not find any information about the CPU, or whatever the 60s version of a CPU was. This system is so obscure I had a quite difficult time finding detailed\nspecifications for it. Supposedly the H316\/Kitchen Computer is based on the DDP-516 (Also made by Honeywell), so perhaps some of the specifications are similar. However I couldn't find any way to verify that.\nThe Kitchen Computer was obviously geared towards housewives who loved to cook. However any housewives who wanted one of these had to shell out A LOT of green, considering the Kitchen Computer sold for $10,600 when it was first introduced (You could buy about four new cars for that much money in 1965!). This price tag included the built-in recipes mentioned earlier, and also included a cookbook and an apron (Oh boy do I hear the laughter now).\nNot much more I can say about the Kitchen Computer. But one things for sure: regardless of how much of a computer geek I consider myself, I'd rather use a good old-fashioned cookbook.\"\nThe display itself was actually a binary display, not a text based one. You\nneeded to learn how to just read it!\nThe language used on the Kitchen Computer was called \"BACK\"\nThere is no record of any Kitchen Computers ever being sold.\nA small reference has been found about the actual computer part of the machine\nbeing used in the initial creation of ARPNET, but it yet has to be confirmed...\nIn addition to being sold as a \"kitchen appliance\" it powered the Mergenthaler Linotype Paul Ltd., Linotron 505.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Jake Wasdin, Torin Darkflight<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=927\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "This machine replaced the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=709\">A4000<\/a>\/<a href=\"computer.asp?c=710\">A5000<\/a> series and was a lower-cost alternative to the RISC PC.  The styling was similar, featuring a very strong but lightweight ABS case with the floppy and CD drive in different places and without the clever stackable case design.\n \nAcorn made the A7000 a very neat system, reducing cost by using far fewer components on the motherboard. 4MB is built into the mainboard with a single 72-pin slot for standard off-the-shelf PC RAM. Gone is the non-standard Acorn 3-button mouse used since the first <a href=\"computer.asp?c=75\">Archimedes<\/a> model, which was expensive and difficult to find if broken or lost, instead a standard PS2 unit is supplied. The only slightly annoying quirk is that you can?t use the optional expansion slot backplane and optional CD drive at the same time as they occupy the same physical area of the small case. One surprise with this machine is the connector on the motherboard marked \"Genlock\", designed for video editing\/combining\/overlaying hardware, such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.millipede.co.uk\/alphas.htm\">Millipede<\/a> AlphaLock Studio. One person has even found a way to wire an Acorn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chiark.greenend.org.uk\/~theom\/riscos\/a4\/lcd7500.html\">A4 LCD<\/a> into it.\nLike the RISC PC, it was usually supplied with a Microvitec multisync SVGA monitor (sometimes with an Acorn badge) which allowed for all the slightly weird screen resolutions that Acorns were capable of, which some PC monitors didn?t like. \nWhen the British supermarket Tesco launched its successful ?computers for schools? charity fundraising scheme, it had the A7000 proudly displayed on its campaign posters. Unfortunately due to the increasing march of PC clones into schools this turned out to be the last all-new design Acorn computer released apart from the Phoebe\/RISC PC II computer which was never released. \nA improved A7000+ was released around 96\/97. There was double the amount of onboard DRAM (now 8MB), and a 1.2GB Seagate hard drive. \nSubmitted by <b>Asteroid<\/b>",

        "description": "The Sharp PC-121x series is generally regarded as the first commercially available pocket computers ever. Its design was based on the way normal pocket calculators were built, but the case was turned 90 degrees to allow for a wider display, and most mathematical function keys were replaced with alphanumerical keys. Its main intended use was BASIC programming, although it could be used as a calculator as well, by simply typing in the math functions with the alphanumerical keyboard in one line of up to 80 characters.\nAs for the release date of the different models, sources somewhat differ, but based on model numbers and a careful examination of exemplars of all three types, the following course of events seems the most probable: The <b>PC-1210<\/b> was the first model, released in 1980. Contrary to the other models, it had only 896 bytes of RAM (1 RAM chip of 1k*4bit = 512 Bytes, plus 3 times 128 Bytes incorporated in the three display chips), resulting in 400 Bytes user memory, shared between BASIC (max. 400 steps) and variables, the so-called \"flexible memories\" (max. 50). Moreover, there are 26 \"fixed memories\" (A~Z) and 48 steps \"reserve memory\", which do not use up any user memory. When looking at the \"inner values\", the PC-1210 looks a bit like a prototype, as there are multiple \"fixes\" on the PCBs, and a small additional PCB with a single logic chip had been squeezed in, which is missing in the later models.\nThis first model was quickly replaced by the <b>PC-1211<\/b>, which was released in the same year, and had two additional RAM chips, thus having 1920 bytes of RAM at its command (1424 steps, 178 flexible memories). The PCB had been slightly redesigned, and some of the chips updated.\nAt the same time, it was also marketed by Tandy\/Radio Shack as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=937\">TRS-80 Pocket Computer<\/a>, which had a slightly earlier version of the main PCBs (judging from the fixes), a slightly different look (outer plastic parts in black, not brown, and gray display frame), but exactly the same technical data.\nIn 1983, the PC-1211 was re-released as the <b>PC-1212<\/b>. The innards are exactly the same (identical PCB number). Allegedly, some minor changes had been made to the ROMs, and the only visible difference was that the display does not have the strangely yellowish background colour, but looks like any LCD as they are commonly known.\nThe PC-121x series provided a display of 24 characters (some of the later Sharp PCs had even less!), and was a pseudo \"multi-processor system\" with two 4bit-CPUs. However, this design was probably not chosen in order to improve speed, but simply because the available CMOS processors did not have enough on-board ROM to implement BASIC functionality in one CPU alone. Thus, they basically do not work in parallel, but in a 'time sharing' manner: CPU I functions to read key-in data or read the instruction to be executed from RAM, and scheduling math operations and BASIC statements. Operations are then performed by CPU II, which also handles display and buzzer output as well as low-level printer and cassette functions.\nThe picture represents a PC-1210 with the <b>CE-122<\/b> printer and cassette interface unit (single needle mechanical dot printer). Other peripherals were the <b>CE-121<\/b> cassette interface, and the <b>CE-152<\/b> tape recorder, which could of course be used with most other models as well.\nSpecial thanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\">site<\/a> for all this information.",

There were some minor differences: The colour style was a bit different, with gray and black prevailing instead of brown, and of course with a Radio Shack type label; moreover, the computer came with a soft (instead of hard) protective case, and an additional Quick Reference Card.\nThe peripherals were  - of course - the same as for the Sharp models: The cassette interface unit (Catalog Number 26-3503), and the printer and cassette interface (26-3505 ), which incorporated a single needle mechanical dot printer.\nSpecial thanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\">site<\/a> for information and picture.",

        "description": "The HP-9810 was the successor of the <b>HP-9100<\/b>. Although it kept software compatibility, its internal hardware organisation was completely different. The core memory was replaced with volatile MOS RAM chips and the display used the new technology of 7-segment light emitting diodes (LED) instead of cathode-ray tube.\nArithmetic routines were stored in ROM and user programs in RAM. Several RAM extensions, specialized ROM modules and peripherals (paper tape reader\/puncher, line printer,  measuring instruments) could be connected to the basic model.\nThe standard version of this calculator included a <b>magnetic card reader<\/b>  located directly behind the two yellow keys at the top-right in the keyboard. While a thermal printer was available as an option, it could only print numeric characters unless you had the Alphanumeric Printer ROM.\nThe add-on ROMs for this machine came in the form of a block that plugged into the left side of the keyboard; each had its own specialized keys. You can see the edges of the ROM block in the picture; the 3x5 array of keys at the leftmost area of the keyboard is its top. It was common to have more than one ROM extension available in a single block, since you could only plug in one at a time.\nWith this first generation of programmable calculators, engineers eventually became independant from main frames and computer centers. They could write programs, save, recall and print them off-line; and even easily carry the computer from a place to another... it was a true revolution at the time.",

While many won?t consider this as being important, this is in fact an interesting detail, because it was usual in the GDR to simply copy the silicon, or try to emulate its behaviour with discrete circuits. \nThe main problem was - as with most electronic items - the price: it sold for about 500 East-German Marks. This was about half of the average wage, thus more than many could afford. This resulted in the fact that this unit was mostly used by educative institutions (e.g. \"Pionierhaus\" - \"House of Pioneers\").\nA successor named \"BSS 02\", probably with colour output instead of B\/W, was planned, but then discarded for the production of radio clocks.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text &amp; info provided by Stefan Goehler<\/font>",

At the time, a special Brazilian regulation allowed local industry to produce and sell copies of foreign computers only to domestic market, however Microdigital computers were also sold in several south American countries.\nDespite the case was quite the same as the original Spectrum, the TK90 wasn't fully compatible with it because of some additions to the software in ROM (User Defined Graphics editor, TRACE function, error messages in portuguese), and also some differences in I\/O ports configuration and addresses. As a result a few games couldn't run on the TK90X, and some Sinclair peripherals could not be used. \nThe TK90X met a large success in Brazil thanks to a vast amount of pirated copies of Spectrum games available in the country.\nMicrodigital announced a <b>Microdrive clone<\/b> but it was never released. However, four other small companies (C.A.S., C.B.I., Syncron and Arcadia) released floppy disk drive interfaces. All interfaces were BetaDisk compatible.

        "description": "TK-3000 was the local version of Apple IIe manufactured in Brazil.\nThere were two models:\n? The full size one, very similar to American Apples\n? A \"Compact\" one, which included following on-board devices:\n- Floppy disk controller,\n- Parallel and serial interfaces\n- A 256Kb memory module.\nDespite Microdigital efforts, TK-3000 lost the battle wih MSX models, mainly due to lack of software in Brazil. \n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Roberto Isiri (info &amp; pix)<\/font>\nAbout the Brazilian regulation that allowed local manufacturers to copy US and U.K. computers, Roberto clarifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe \"clones\" made in Brazil during the 80's actually were licensed products.\nAlthough Brazilian Government forced us to manufacture our hardware, the technology and some main components such as processors and printer heads were imported from the American and European manufacturers.\nBy that time, we had no user assembled (w\/o brand) PC's. This situation changed in early 90's, when the laws became softer and the Chinese boards and cheap refurbished components arrived. It was the end of locally branded computers...\n<\/font>\nbut <b>Ernesto Hublard<\/b> corrects:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nMost of the Brazilian manufacturers copied US and UK computers without neither licence nor agreement from the brands they copied. Sinclair sued Microdigital  for this reason. Another company made an Apple Macintosh clone without any agreement from Apple.<\/font>\n<b>Gabriel Gra?a<\/b> replies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Ernesto forgets that the clones were not illegal under brazilian law. The WTO did not yet exist, and foreign computer companies were barred from Brazil. The only foreign company that obtained a licence to sell in Brazil was HP (they sold the HP85B). Apple only managed to stop the production of the Mac clone because the US threatened Brazil with trade sanctions.<\/font>",

Though it looks like a classic pong system, it is interesting for at least two reasons.\nFirst, the paddles are built with calculator or remote control plastic cases !! Indeed, once opened, you can clearly see the holes planned for the plastic keys (see \"more pictures\" section)...\nThe second unsual fact is that, thanks to the GI AY-3-8500-7 chipset, the system offers a game rarely found on most pongs : F?tbol de 5 (soccer with 5 players)! Indeed one player control 3 paddles and the other \"only\" two... that is weird.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Sebastian Rho for pictures &amp; info<\/font>\n<b>David Winter says:<\/b>\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nFor the 5-players soccer game (in fact 2 paddles for left player and 3 for right one), it is a non-documented game. It is normaly possible to play it on any pong system (GI chipset powered) if you can manage to not select any game (game switch must not indicate any game). Some systems, like the Interton Video 2400 if I recall correctly can play this game though... I don't know what differences has the AY-3-8500-7 compared to the standard AY-3-8500 version... I know there is also a AY-3-8500-1x but I have no info about it. It is certainly a question of internal revision.<\/font>",

        "description": "The HP <b>9810<\/b>, <b>9820<\/b> and <b>9830<\/b> were all announced simultaneously by HP in the December 1972 HP Journal. They were all four bit machines and all of them used a serial bus internally. \nThe 9830 was by far the most capable machine of this group and ran what HP called BASIC Plus. In many ways, it was one of the first true \"Personal Computers\" ever marketed.\nThe 9830 was also significantly more expandable than the 9810\/9820, with five user-accessable ROM cartridge slots. The <b>9830-B<\/b> was introduced four years later in the 1977 HP catalog. HP said that three things set the HP 9830 apart from the other desktop systems:\n? First, it's used of <b>BASIC Plus<\/b> with it's English like vocabulary and structure,\n? Second, the entire operating system and firmware were in ROM and did not take up any of the read\/write memory space,\n? Third, the use of the cassette tape drive with features that they said were only found on large computers.\nThe basic 9830 came with 1760 16 bit words of memory, a 32 character display, the cassette tape drive and a large well-featured keyboard.\n\nIn addition to the ROM cartridge slots, the 9830 could hold three more ROMs internally. The internal ROMs were on cards instead of plug in cartridges and had to be installed by HP. When the internal ROMs or extra memory were installed, a sticker that listed the ROM or new memory size and option number was added to the outside ROM door.\nThe <b>9830A<\/b> came with 3520 bytes (1760 words) of memory and could be expanded up to 15808 bytes (7904 words). The <b>9830B<\/b> came with 15808 bytes (7904 words) of memory and could be expanded up to 30144 bytes (15072 words). The Matrix and String Variables ROM cards were also standard in the 9830-B. \nThe HP 9830 was commonly found with a special version of HP <b>9866 printer<\/b> (see picture) that sits on top of the calculator and looks like it's part of the original machine. The 9866 was a full width page printer that printed up to 80 columns of characters on thermal roll paper. It could print a full 80 character width using 5 x 7 dot matrix characters at 240 lines per minute. It could also print simple plots and tables or other formatted text. The \"B\" version of this printer was introduced in 1977 and it added the capability of printing both upper and lower case letters and vertical lines. The printer used a short cable that connected to a special socket on the back of the computer. \nThe HP 9830 was dropped from the HP catalog after 1977 or 1978. But, in 2000, some companies still used it...since 1975! \nThanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.classiccmp.org\/hp\/joespage.htm\">Joe<\/a> for most of the information.",

It was a quite powerful system, mainly used in education, and also known in some Western European countries.\nLike in many Eastern clones, the processor was a Russian version of the Z80A (UA800). However, the Hobbit had several powerful additional features: CP\/M mode, Shadow mode allowing numerous BASIC extensions, various EEPROM configurations with additional languages like LOGO, Pascal, C or FORTH, network capabilities...\nThe early version of the Hobbit was a very limited edition and stoped being manufactured around early 1990. But at that time, another manufacturer called <b>InterCompex<\/b> changed it into the later version with numeric keypad and more features.\nThe Rage Hard magazine wrote about the Hobbit: \"<font color=\"#555555\">The Hobbit is a Soviet Spectrum clone that does everything Uncle Clive built into the original Speccy, plus lot of the things he forgot...<\/font>\" :-)\nAfter switching on the Hobbit, you could see classic Sinclair screen, but in the Russian Cyrillic language. Furthermore, there was a special key allowing the user to switch between the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets.\nOne of the most amazing features was something like the early RAID system.

First models shipped with a standard TV set instead of a monitor.\nThe IMKO-1 was actually an almost 100% compatible <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> system featuring same expansion slots. Sadly, neither expansion card nor floppy disk unit were available in Bulgaria. Some rare customers bought them from Western European countries or from Taiwan, others used a tape recorder.\n \nThe first international presentation of the IMKO-1 occured at Robotics Symposium in England. Bulgaria demonstrated then a robot controlled by a microcomputer. At this time, Japaneses and U.S. robots were controlled by minicomputers. The IMKO-1 robot system cost thus ten times cheaper and its maintenance was much more easy.",

It was mainly used in the UK by Dixons chain dealers. Of course, very few models were produced.\nWhen opening the front side of the sturdy aluminium case, one finds a metal plate covering the main board, actually a CPC 464+ motherboard, and a daughterboard holding 13 cartridge connectors. The first connector always holds a custom main cartridge which controls the CSD system. Twelve connectors remain free for standard game cartridges. The two boards are connected together through the cartridge and parallel ports of the motherboard.\nWhen the cartridges are inserted and the front cover is closed, a superb Welcome picture appears on the screen with a 4096-colour wave background. It is then possible to select a cartridge and run a game, or let the machine run all the games successively. A timer then allows the user to select how long each game will be played.\nThanks to <b>Charles da Silva<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/amstrad.cpc.free.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\">site<\/a> for information and pictures.\n<b>Charles<\/b> also adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nAs Roland Perry told me, Amstrad used not only CPC 464+ motherboards but also GX-4000 PCBs.

The MK-14 project was thus managed by <b>Chris Curry<\/b> and produced by National Semiconductor. As the system was five times cheaper than its closest competitor, the Compukit UK-101, about 20,000 MK-14 boards were sold in the U.K. \nChris Curry, who believed much more than Clive Sinclair in the future of such computers, left the company in 1978, founded <b>Acorn Computers<\/b> with <b>Herman Hauser<\/b> and built its fist computer kit, the <b>System 1<\/b>. A few months later, Clive Sinclair decided that computers were a good way to raise money and started a new project: a complete computer for less than ?100. \nMeantime, the MK-14 grew into a modular system and several additional cards allowed expansion of the system: cassette interface, text and graphics video module and Eprom programmer. 128 and 256 bytes RAM expansion chips could also be added up to a total of 640 bytes. Yes...640 BYTES... \nThe version pictured here is an issue 4 with a better mechanical keyboard than the 'sensitive' one of the earlier versions, as well as optional RAM and I\/O chips.

        "description": "After the successful <a href=\"computer.asp?c=936\">PC-121x series<\/a>, the PC-1500 was the second pocket computer released by Sharp, and their first one based on an 8 bit microprocessor. It might be contended that the PC-1500 was THE milestone in pocket computers. It was very popular among computer hobbyists, and it was used by many companies who equipped their field staff with the machine.\nWhy was this so? Actually, the technical specifications were not overwhelming: its display was only two characters longer than its predecessor's, but at least it featured \"one line graphics\", i.e. it was a \"gap-less\" display with 7 x 156 pixels.\nWith 3.5 KB memory, the PC-1500 had not much more RAM available for BASIC (1850 bytes) than the PC-1211 (1424 steps). Moreover, it was quite bulky (25 mm thick, 375 g), supposedly mainly because it used 4 normal AA batteries as power supply. However, the latter fact might have been an advantage, as these batteries are cheap and easily replacable.\nPresumably, the most important advantage was the expandability of the system. Several RAM extensions (some even with battery back-up), program modules, a \"docking station\" with cassette interface and colour plotter with full graphics capabilites accessible with BASIC, an external board with programmable function buttons, various interfaces etc. were available. Moreover, the PC-1500 was also programmable in machine code. Apart from that, nothing comparable was available from other manufacturers at that time. Later strongest competitor Casio had their <a href=\"computer.asp?c=987\">FX-702P<\/a>, and they were only about to release their <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1000\">PB-100<\/a> which had rather weak specifications.\nThe PC-1500 was released in late 1981 in Japan and early 1982 in the rest of the world. It was built around the <b>LH 5801<\/b> 8-bit CMOS processor which ran at 1.3 MHz. The RAM consisted of three parts. The 1KB system RAM was made up by two TC5514 1k x 4bit chips, a legacy from the PC-121x series. This area was used for system memory and part of the fixed variables. User RAM was realised with a HM6116 2k x 8 bit chip, most of it available for BASIC (1850 Bytes). Additional 512 Bytes incorporated in the display driver chips were used for the rest of the fixed variables and the display buffer.\nThe RAM could be expanded by RAM modules in different sizes, the largest of which was 16KB (actually, there was also a 32KB module, which had two switchable 16KB pages, i.e. only 16KB could be used at a time). There was also a widely known method to build a self-made RAM expansion up to 32KB.\nAs with the PC-1211, there was a custom manufactured version of the PC-1500 built by Sharp for Tandy Radio Shack, called the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=967\">TRS-80 PC-2<\/a>. Apart from a different keyboard layout, it was identical.\nTwo years later, the slightly expanded model <b>PC-1500A<\/b> was released (in Japan and maybe some other countries labelled as <b>PC-1501<\/b>). It was equipped with four HM6116 RAM chips, which made 5946 Bytes available for BASIC, and an additional 1KB area for machine code only.\nThanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\">site<\/a> for information and picture.",

        "description": "Very little is known about this Japanese system. Help welcome !!\nIt apparently had some success in Japan, with great game conversions. Based on the IBM PC architecture, it had excellent sound and graphic features.\nIt has the barebone of a classic IBM PC system but was conceived from the start as a real familial multimedia system. Graphic resolutions go from 360x240 to 640x480 with 256 colors simultaneously on screen from a color palette of 16.7 millions colors. Most of these graphic modes have two graphic pages. Up to 1024 sprites can be created, with 16x16 pixels size each.\nThe sound features are excellent too. It can play stereo CDs of course, thanks to its built-in CD-ROM drive. It also has 8 PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) stereo voices, thanks to a Sega chipset, which is generally used for special effect sounds. A Yamaha FM chipset is also included and offers 6 FM channels, mostly used for melodies...\nThe FM Towns is delivered with a joypad, a microphone and a mouse. The operating system, Town OS, is graphical and use windows, scrollers, icons, etc. The system is somehow compatible with other IBM PC systems, using a special version of DOS + DOS Extender. It can even run Windows !\nWhere does the name FM Towns come from? In those days, Fujitsu named its PC products after nobel-prized scientists. So, the codename of the first model of FM TOWNS is thus \"Townes\", in honour of Charles Hard Townes, one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics. But the word \"TOWNES\" could be pronounced \"Tau-Ness\", so to be clear that it has to be pronounced \"Townz\", the letter \"e\" was removed from the codename before production. The word \"FM\" comes from \"Fujitsu Micro\". \nIt was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=384\">FM Towns II<\/a>.",

        "description": "The <b>ICON<\/b> workstation and <b>LEXICON<\/b> file server were originally designed by <b>Cemcorp<\/b>, the Canadian Educational Microprocessor Corporation, specifically for use in Canadian schools. They were first produced by <b>Burroughs<\/b> then took the name of <b>Unisys<\/b> when Burrough and Sperry merged to form Unisys. \nUp to about 20 diskless workstations got everything off of the central file-server. They ran <b>QNX<\/b>, a flavour of Unix operating system with optional GUI shell. The workstations offered a graphical interface including windows, pick-areas, and a tracker\/cursor that responded to the user through manipulation of a trackball located onto the keyboard. Two versions of the GUI interface were available, called <b>Ambience<\/b> and <b>ICONLook<\/b>, as well as a file manager called <b>House<\/b>. \nThe Lexicon were 80186-based servers. They contained 1 or 2 8-inch floppy drives and a 70 MB hard disk. Standard programming languages (Basic, Pascal, Fortran, C) came from Watcom. A word processor and a spreadsheet were also available.\nHowever, the LEXICON-ICON systems were very expensive and suffered from a lack of educational software. They were replaced with IBM PC and AT systems and were quickly forgotten.\nThere were also Icon II and Icon III computers, see the link section for more information.",

        "description": "In March 1951, The <b>Eckert and Mauchly Computer Co.<\/b> of Philadelphia delivered the UNIVAC 1 (Universal Automatic Computer) to the U.S. Census Bureau. The machine was put into service on June 14, 1951. It was retired on October 3, 1963 after 73,000 hours of operation. In the meantime, <b>Remington Rand<\/b> (now Unisys Corp.) sold 45 UNIVAC 1 machines to U.S. government agencies and private-industry.\nAlthough it was not the first commercial computer (The Ferranti Mark I was delivered a few months earlier), the Univac 1 is considered the first modern digital computer and marked the real beginning of the computer industry. For five years, this was the best large scale computer in use for data processing. Technically, it was the first where the program and data were stored in the same memory space, data and programs were fetched from memory, manipulated in registers, and results returned to memory. Every computer since the Univac 1 has used some variation of that architecture.\nThe beast was really imposing, It weighted more than 13 tons, held 5200 vacuum tubes and used 125 Kwatts of electricity. A simple addition instruction took about 100 microseconds (about 200,000 times slower than a Pentium III), time for a divide instruction was of 3,600 microseconds. Large magnetic tape units and card puncher\/readers were used for data input, storage and output. Results could also be printed on a high-speed printer (600 lines per minute).\nThe first computer game was created on the Univac. It was called NIM and allowed humans to compete against the machine in a mathematical contest.\nIn 1952, the Univac also correctly predicted that Eisenhower would win in the Eisenhower-Stevenson presidential race, but the news media decided not to make the prediction public.\nThanks to <b>Andy Davis<\/b> for the picture.\n__________\n<b>William F. Steagall<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I was a junior engineer at Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp. My role in designing UNIVAC was small, but I did make a contribution to it. \nOne clarification I would offer is that during the 1952 elections, the program we ran to forecast the victor in the presidential election had Eisenhower as winner as soon as the first few votes came in. Dramatic efforts were made to reduce the prediction of 100 to one for Eisenhower, but we never got the forecast below about 20 to one. \nWe had wonderful fun doing our jobs. <\/font>",

It was used as a standard primary school computer in Croatia from 1985 to 1991.\nOrao (code named YU102) was designed by Miroslav Kocijan to supersede <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1048\">Galeb<\/a> (code named YU101). The goal was to make a better computer, yet with less components, easier to produce and less expensive. Originally a Motorola 6809 microprocessor was planned but was abandoned for the MOS 6502 due to being significantly more expensive.\"<\/i> (source : <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orao_%28computer%29\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia<\/a>)\nOrao was the computer of choice back in the eighties for educational \nuse in the Croatian elementary schools. When turned on it would start \nthe monitor, and you had to type a command to start the BASIC. There is no text mode. Characters are drawn in graphic mode in an 8x8 grid, allowing the system to display 32 characters x 32 lines.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Zoran Majcenic reports (source = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homecomputer.de\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.homecomputer.de<\/a>):<\/b>\nIn 1985 in Croatia (then Yugoslavia), for purposes of education, a microcomputer called Orao (Eagle) was made for elementary schools. I believe that 2 per school were produced (so they are rare). It is a computer with 16 or 32 kb of memory, 6502 processor, internal speaker, 256x256 monochrome display, built-in BASIC and MONITOR programs. It can be connected using antenna or VIDEO connector. The PSU is integrated in its casing so you just directly plug it in power outlet.\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Also, according to Karlo Siljeg (source = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homecomputer.de\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.homecomputer.de<\/a>):<\/b>\n\"Orao\" was made by a company called PEL Varazdin, Velebit was the distributor. Velebit also distributed a number of Apple II Compatible computers called \"Impuls\". Impuls was a Apple II compatible made by Ivel. Ivel was a company which made oil equipment. It manufactured microcontrollers and branched out in making Apple II compatibles. The company was based in the town of Ivanjic Grad. The Ivel micro was also distributed under the Ivel name as Ivel Ultra. The Ivel micro was one of the \"standard\" machines by the education board and they which were distributed in Croatia (then Yugoslavia) by the education department as Impuls. The company Velebit which imported Apple's into Croatia also distributed Ivels and Orao machines\n<b>Sinisa Kolaric<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n\"Orao\" came bundled with a small black-and-white monochrome monitor. Also, the mentioned \"MONITOR\" program was actually a rudimentary assembler for 6502. It was a basic but architecturally clean machine, relatively powerful for that age. Something like C64 but without frills. A perfect introduction to the IBM PC which came a little bit later, along with the Amiga and Atari ST.<\/font>\n\t\n<\/font><\/font>",

        "description": "This is a typical system using catridges based on the different chipsets developped by General Instruments in the late 70s. Each GI chips was able to generate several games, ball games for a start, then later car racing, motorcycle, submarines, tanks and shooting games.\nThe system has two hardwired controllers with one analog joystick and one fire button each. The control panel is composed of 10 orange buttons to select the different games offered by each cartridge (10 being the maximum). Difficulty switches, power knob (acting as a volume control as well), service auto\/manual switch and a start button can also be found.\nFirst systems were produced without connectors for the rifles. But from 1983, and for a small fee, you could send back your console to Rollet and they would add the light gun connectors ! But what is strange is that most systems without these connectors, had however the holes drawn and marked on the plastic case, just as if there were planned from the beginning...\nThe Rollet Video Secam System 4\/303 was sold in France at the start of the 80's. It was marketed as a console for children, rather than a \"serious\" gaming system. Rollet also sold at the same time the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=822\">Videocolor<\/a>, another system for kids, completely different from the Video Secam System, but which is also refered as 4\/303 (on a label below the system)! Weird... The Rollet Video Secam System 4\/303 was also sometimes referenced as the Rollet Tronic...\nOn the electronic board of the Video Secam System is written \"SD-050s\". Once again, we have a system being part of the SD-050 big family conceived by Soundic. Many brands, european for the most, bought these systems and sold them with their own brand name and sometimes even original case (like here with the Rollet Video Secam System).

        "description": "This little-known graphics workstation is an intriguing example of the many, varied machines introduced in the mid 1980's.\nThe Mindset microcomputer, designed by two ex-Atari engineers, offered graphics performance far beyond that of other personal computers on the market at the time of its introduction in early 1984.\nBased on the rarely seen, 16-bit Intel 80186 (also used in the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1219\">Tandy Model 2000<\/a>), the Mindset was a powerful graphics workstation built on a (mostly) MS-DOS compatible core. Two custom VLSI chips shouldered the burden of graphics heavy lifting; offering graphics performance 50 times that of the IBM PC, leaving the CPU free to handle other chores.\nThe system unit was striking to behold.  Crafted by industrial design group, <b>GVO<\/b>, of Menlo Park, CA, the Mindset was chosen for a place in the Museum of Modern Art.\nThe main system unit lacked floppy disk storage but instead sported two, front-mounted ROM\/NVRAM module ports. The system's serial and parallel interface, as well as system memory expansion, were also modular.  A dual floppy drive expansion module attached to the top of the unit, giving it a futuristic, double-decker look (most units were sold with the floppy drive module bundled in).   \nThe Mindset was one of the very first computers to come standard with a mouse; in this case, a two-button unit with a somewhat unwieldy, heavy cord and a metal mouse ball.\n<brw the mindset offered>11 advanced graphics modes which could be seen on any of the system's three graphics outputs; impressive flexibility for its day.  A very powerful paint program, <b>Lumena<\/b> from Time Arts, Inc., was available for the Mindset, allowing the creation of stunning, static images from its palette of 512 colors.  Beyond the static, however, the machine's custom graphics hardware was capable of performing frame buffer animation at a speed 50 times greater than that of the IBM PC.\nThere were rumors that Atari CEO, Jack Tramiel, was considering purchasing the Mindset  to bring it under the Atari flag.  This did not happen, but it is interesting to note that the original <a href=\"computer.asp?c=922\">Atari ST<\/a> series computers, released a year later, featured almost exactly the same graphics modes and palette depth as the Mindset micro.\nMore information about this notable entry in computing history can be  \nfound at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atarimagazines.com\/creative\/v11n2\/50_Mindset_micro_pushing_th.php%20\">this on-line version<\/a> of a Feb.

        "description": "The FX-702P was Casio's answer to Sharp's <a href=\"computer.asp?c=936\">PC-121x<\/a> series. In certain ways, this machine marks the transition from keystroke programmables such as the FX-601P\/602P to \"real\" pocket computers. On the one hand, Casio labeled the FX-702P only as \"Programmable Calculator\", and its non-QWERTY layout of the alphanumerical keys differentiate it from most later pocket computers. On the other hand, the FX-702P had a viable BASIC interpreter which allows for more flexible programming.\nThe hardware mainly consists of four CMOS LSI chips incorporating logical functions and memory, and four display driver chips. The display provides 20 characters in 5x7 pixel matrix, plus a separate 7-segment display part indicating the remaining program memory.\nComparable to the Sharp PC-1211 and 1212, the FX-702P had about 2 KB of RAM, divided into 1680 BASIC steps and 26 memories; more memory for variables could be partitioned out at the expense of BASIC memory. A memory expansion slot was built-in, but a suitable RAM module never came out. \nWith this model, Casio introduced their method of dividing program memory into 10 autonomous areas - P0 to P9 - which continued to be implemented in all following Casio models for many years.\nThe nonstandard keyboard makes it most cumbersome to use for anybody familiar with the QWERTY standard; on the other hand, triple assignments of most keys makes programming somewhat more efficient.\nThe built-in interpreter supports a variant of the BASIC language, with some keywords spelled in a different way than the later quasi-standard, e.g. PRT instead of PRINT, or GSB and RET for GOSUB and RETURN. Compared to Sharp's PC-121x models, it has substantially more mathematical and statistical functions, string manipulation functions and a more flexible variable handling scheme.\nTwo peripheral devices were available:\n? The <b>FA-2<\/b> Cassette Interface, which, as a side note, could also play musical notes when used with the FX-501P\/FX-502P or FX-601P\/602P calculators, but not with the FX-702P,\n?

        "description": "The Pravetz 8D was a Bulgarian clone of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=79\">Oric Atmos<\/a> featuring a Bulgarian version of the 6502 processor called CM630, 16 KB of ROM and 48 KB of RAM\nThe keyboard was almost the same as the original Atmos version, including a MK key, similar to the CTRL key, a C\/L key allowing to display Cyrillic or Latin alphabets, and cursor keys. As in <a href=\"computer.asp?c=956\">Pravets 82<\/a> (etc), the original lowercase characters were replaced by cyrillic characters and the C\/L lock key, was the CAPS LOCK key of the Oric Atmos.\nLike the original Atmos, The 8D had two modes of recording : Fast mode at 2400 bits\/sec. and slow mode at 300 bits\/sec.\nThe computer also featured a parallel Centronics interface and a user port. Pravetz provided a local dot matrix printer called \"Petritch\" but the popular Epson printers could be also connected to the 8D.\nThe \"D\" after Pravets 8 stays for \"??????\" (Domashen = For home use), and the idea was, that it should be used without having to buy any peripherals - monitor (which couldn't be connected through composite video to a Pravets 8D without modification) and FDD (cassete recorder used instead).\nFloppy drives, modem and joysticks were also available. Floppy disk drives  were very hard to find (in fact they appeared only in the early nineteens). They were a modification of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=956\">Pravetz 82<\/a> FDDs but with a built-in controller, making them two times bigger. Probably that was one of the reasons why Pravetz 8D never achieved the popularity ot Pravetz 8 (despite of the 3 times lower price).\nThere were in fact two ways to have floppy disk drives for the Pravetz 8D. One was indeed to use Pravetz 82 FDD and to develop an additional controller + power supply (the schematic and firmware were published in \"Computer for you\" magazine). There was an operating system called DOS 8D, developed in Bulgaria by Borislav Zahariev.\nLater, Pravetz factory decided to develop special FDD for the 8D, which was bundled with the controller and the power supply in a box twice bigger than the normal Apple ][ floppy. It came out on market when the production of the computer itself was finished! It used also modified version of DOS 8D for DIY floppy.\nThe computer was very well crafted and the survived systems often look as new.\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributed to this page : <b>Bozhidar Stefanov, Jordan,  anonymous visitor<\/b><\/font>\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Peter Petrov<\/b> reports:\n<b>ROM<\/b>\nThere are several rom images of the basic in Pravetz. If you wand disk emulation you need 8DControllerROM and use CALL#320 command.\n<b>RAM<\/b>\nWith Basic you have 48 K RAM to work, but with this little schematics you can use additional 16K. The signals that you need for proper work are these.\nOne trigger is used to form MAP signal, but second is free to use additional thing. If you realise schematis of disk controller below you can use these schematics together to load 8DDOS v2.10 in additional RAM.\nYou must use write operation in these adresses to use the controller:\n#380 - writing in additional RAM - additional thing is off\n#381 - writing and reading in additional RAM - additional thing is off\n#382 - writing in additional RAM - additional thing is on\n#383 - writing and reading in additional RAM - additional thing is on\nfor \"additional thing\" see Disk controller section\nSo, if you realise this little controller you can use:\nFOR I = #C000 TO #CFFF : POKE I,0 : NEXT - clearing first 4K of additional RAM\nor you can move the basic interpreter in additional memory and use:\nPOKE #381,0\nto go in RAM interpreter and make changes in it.\n<b>DISK CONTROLLER<\/b>\nIf you have Apple ][ floppy drive and disk controller you can use this schematics to connect them to your Pravetz (Oric). The schematics is from two parts:\nbuffers\ncontroller\nThe signals for proper work of the controller are here:\nYou can change the signal Q with changing the resistors of monovibrator 74LS123.\nThe record of EPROM is here:\nYou must write it from addres #20 of the EPROM.\nConnecting RAM controller and disk controller:\nyou can connect these controllers by this way:\npin 9 of 74LS74 is connecting to A8 addres bar of 2716 EPROM, so the \"additional thing\" is second page of the EPROM, where is the program of loading DOS 8D v.2.1 into additional RAM. (The record of the EPROM above is exatly for first and second page).\n<b>SOFTWARE<\/b>\nThe versions of the DOS I have are:\nDos 8D v1.0 - you can use it if you realise only the schematics of the disk controller, but this versions loads in normal RAM, so it is unusable with long games.\nDos 8D v.2.1 - you can use it if you realise the two schematics and connect them. So - dos loads in additional RAM  and you can use all the programs you have.\nYou can use regular Oric software in Pravetz 8D, but you have not regular letters. You have cyrillic letters instead. Changing of the keyboard maps is with Ctrl-T.\nThere are some games for Pravetz like SnakeByte, Tetris (exellent clone) and other. Most of them are from Bulgarian computer magazine \"Computer for you\". There is 80 column text editor, Disk copier program and the most beautiful - Borislav Zahariev ported BigMac Assembler from Apple ][ to Pravetz, so you can use if you realise schematics above. Soon I hope you will see this software here.\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "In 1986, the 900th Anniversary of the Norman Domesday Book, the BBC and \nthe National Curriculum, amongst other UK bodies, endeavoured to \nproduced a 20th Century equivalent. Recently the Domesday project has \nhad renewed interest, as the sense of producing such an ambitious \nundertaking then storing the results on a strange, and now forgotten, \nformat has been called into question many times since!\nFor old-computers.com readers, the interesting bits are not terribly \ninteresting - but they are scarce. The presentation was viewable on one \nof two platforms - the main, and the one most associated with it, was \nthe BBC Master AIV (Advanced Interactive Video). This isn't an \n'official' term - as far as Acorn and the BBC were concerned, they \nwanted schools to purchase the system in the belief that it was \nessentially what they were used to. The BBC Master was an off the shelf \nMaster Turbo, with an additional SCSI interface (possibly \nelectronically derived from the SCSI interface built into the ACW), and \nan additional filing system to access the LV-ROM.\nThe VP415 LV-ROM was an industrial Philips Laservision player, already \n'programmable' according to the Laservision standards. The storage was \nbroken down into volumes, with data encoded along with the video \ncontent (which can be played separately). The SCSI interface allowed \ndata retrieval but this was also possible via the RS-232 interface - \nand a module to allow the other machine popular in schools at the time \naccess - the RM Nimbus. The actual data format on the disc was \ncontrolled by LV-DOS in the player, and VFS in the BBC series computer. \nWhilst the Master AIV was most definitely marketed for this \napplication, the documentation is quite vague about whether a BBC B \ncould be used, implying that merely the VFS ROM is required!\nVideo from the laserdisc was mixed using a genlock incorporated in the \nbase of the VP415 with data generated by the Domesday applications and \ndisplayed on a SCART monitor.\nApplications allowed searching of film content, further exploration of \nthe information, such as going into a house pictured (within \nlimitations, of course!), and statistical analysis of data gathered in \na project that involved schools all over the UK. It's quite likely that \nmany people of my generation contributed, in some small part, to the \nDomesday project.\nAdditional discs were produced for educational purposes, hoping to \nexpand the applications of the AIV system, but the late 80s was to see \nthe advent of Microsoft's \"Multimedia PC\" standard, Philips' own CDi, \nand many other CD (rather than LD) based systems. LV-ROM, in addition \nto the video and still frames, could store just under 400Mb of data on \na 12\" optical disc - whilst the video would take up more space on CD, \nthe media was physically fragile and was eventually to be rendered \nobsolete with the end of the VP415.\nProjects to restore the Domesday project are hampered by copyright law \nand the restrictions of accessing the data, The most successful is \nLeeds University's CAMeLION project, an emulated system, with some \nPC-based applications. I am undertaking my own 'accessible' project, to \nattempt to make the material useable in a wide range of consumer \nfriendly appliances, but like everyone else, am tied by the fragility \nof the hardware (if anyone has parts for the VP415 I need spares!) and \nof course, copyright law.\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks A LOT to Richard Kilpatrick for all this info.<\/font>",

        "description": "Acorn's ABC-310 was to be the flagship of the Acorn business computer range. As far as I can tell, the 310 is the rarest variant, and it is the only one to have no direct equivalent available via a 2nd Processor card. \nWhen the ABC range was dissolved, Acorn already had 2nd Processors (a method of adding a new CPU to the BBC, similar to adding a Z80 on a card to an Apple II, but very different in execution and with far more applications) - the 65C02, the Z80, the Acorn Scientific 16032 (1MB RAM, compared to 4MB in the Cambridge Workstation\/ABC-210). \nHowever, the 80286 board in the 310 would never surface outside of these prototype machines. Acorn would indulge in Intel-based co-processors later, the 80186 in the BBC Master 512, and various 486\/586 based cards for the Archimedes (3rd party, perhaps?) and the RiscPC. \nTechnically speaking, the 286 had more direct application support, was potentially faster, and was a smaller package than the ageing 16032. It was also more easily obtained. Why it was never released is beyond me - except that the 286 was a very new CPU at the time, and may have been expensive. \nRunning ABC-310s seem to be very hard to find, and information on them is scarce. They look identical, from the outside, to the ABC-110 and any other of the Cambridge Workstations. \n<font color=\"#666666\">\n_________\nText and info by Richard Kilpatrick. Thanks a LOT !<\/font>\n<b>Jules Richardson<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I'm told by an ex-Acorn engineer that only a handful of boards were commissioned - but that not all of these were assembled into complete machines. The design and code for the 80286 board fed into the later Master 512 coprocessor.\nI'm only aware of two surviving machines - the one pictured here and one other in private hands, although one or two of the coprocessor boards themselves are known to have survived.\nI *assume* that it just wasn't cost-effective to market the 310 machines - and that the 80286 board was never released as a separate coprocessor because Acorn wanted to protect their Master 512 interests, and a faster rival board that wasn't internal to the Master would not have helped this.<\/font>",

The nodes were connected in a 3-D torus network configuration.\nMemory was physically distribued among the processors, but was globally addressable (any processor could address any memory location in the system.\nThe global peak performance of a T3D was from 19 (128 PE's) to 307 (2048 PE's) GigaFlops (billions floating-point operations per second).\nThe system ran UNICOS MAX, the Cray Research's operating system. Each processor ran a minimal microkernel to handle frequently used functions, interprocessor communication and memory management. Major programming language were C and Fortran compilers\nThe T3D was tightly coupled to a CRAY <b>C90<\/b> or CRAY <b>Y-MP<\/b> host system through a high speed channel, making host's resources (I\/O functionality, I\/O subsystem, high-speed disks) directly available to the T3D.\nThe Cray T3D was replaced by the <b>T3E<\/b>, the first supercomputer to sustain one teraflop (1 trillion F.P. calculations per second).",

Three 8000 series systems were bought from CPT and sold under the Bull label, the <b>TTX-80<\/b>, <b>TTX-85<\/b> and <b>TTX-90<\/b>. \nThese massive systems featured an Intel 8080 processor, 64 to 256 KB of RAM, a dual 8\" floppy drive and above, a portrait monitor that could display a full page of A4. They were connected to a dedicated daisywheel printer and a 300-baud modem.\nThey could be connected to a 61 DPS\/2 Bull Computer through the \"Buroth?que\" software, allowing the documents to be sorted, archived or read directly from TTX system. The 61 DPS\/2 then acts as a document server.\nThe TTX-90 was the last machine bought by Bull. Because of the very high prices of the CPT systems (at least 15,000 Euros), they finally produced their own dedicated word processing system, the TTX-35.\nThe TTX systems ran a very unique multitasking interrupt driven OS, able to save and retreive instantly a full A4 page of formatted text. However CPT did eventually offer standard CP\/M 2.2 as alternate OS, though they did not call it CP\/M.\nDue to its high price level, the TTX systems did not meet a large success, except in Bull offices and some French public services.",

        "description": "P5000 came in two major types. One was 8080 based, and the other was Z80 based. RAM on the 8080 was 64K, 128K on the Z80. The Z80 was used on the \"twin\" (two terminal and two printer) version, and the Cluster (or 4 Head\/4 terminal version).\nSoftware was remarkably efficient, copies going between the two floppies, printing, and editing all at the same time on up to 4 terminals, on an 8 bit CPU and 128K of RAM.\nThe software was originanally developed in Ottawa, lead by the person who would become company president. Company started as Micom, and was eventually bought by Philiips.\nThe pictured model is a P5004, second generation from P5002 series. This huge system (at least 50 kg) was conceived by D. K. Hammer at system software development department of Philips in Vienna, but manufactured in Canada. It was commonly connected to a Qume daysywheel printer and was used not only for word processing, but also as billing, accounting or specialized system for technical or scientific documents production.\nFirst P5000s did not boot from a floppy but from a Magnetic card reader. The ?Schugart? 8? drives came later. Each 300 KB 8\" floppy disc could store up to 128 A4 size pages.\nThere was also a <b>P5040<\/b> third generation which looked like a modern pc. This was the last of the dedicated Philips word processors.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b>: Kevin Holdaway, Kostas Kritsilas<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=994\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

This was also the first PC to offer IBM's MCA expansion bus.\nThe QI-300 was followed by the <b>Qi 600<\/b> (80386DX-25) and the <b>Qi 900<\/b> (80486DX)\n__________\nThanks to <b>Charles Verrier<\/b> for this information.\n<b>Christopher Davies<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nI used to maintain these computers many years ago. They were very IBM like inside and sported a 40 MB tape drive on the left hand side. The MCA I am sure was brown in colour. A very smart machine. They seamed very popular in tire replacement places meaning they got very grimy and dirty.<\/font>\n<b>Warlord0<\/b> recalls:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nOoh man glory days.  I used to work for an Apricot reseller and put in a lot of Qi and Xen\/Xen-S machines. The Qi was revolutionary.  It had an MCA card that could be installed to work with an infra-red security card that would encrypt the hard drive!\nApricot were light years ahead of their time.  Wireless keyboard and mouse, trackballs, calculators in the keyboard.  This stuff was brilliant British design. Sadly the buy out by Mitsubishi killed them off.\nI do remember the motherboards being released to the public being so poor in quality due to their \"bleeding edge\" design that many upgrades were done by soldering wires between chips post production.\nBut they hold a special place in my heart.  Gotta love 'em.<\/font>",

The system used an OEM\nversion of MS-DOS 2.11, modified to work with its non-standard BIOS and\nhardware.   Simple DOS applications that did not make use of IBM BIOS calls\nor of lower-level hardware would work.\nOptionally there was an expansion board called <b>SLE<\/b> (for Software Library Expander) which some nicknamed <i>the SLEeze board<\/i>.  This board included a second 8086 processor, Phoenix BIOS and memory.  In conjunction with its accompanying software this board\nallowed for \"more PC compatibility\" by emulating a true PC clone with CGA\ngraphics.  Accounts of how well this actually worked vary.\nNEC also ported a version of <b>System III UNIX<\/b> and released it as <b>PC-UX<\/b>\navailable as an optional OS. NEC also provided a hardware-based\nvirtual memory paging board for PC-UX which helped performance.\nOther options included a 10MB hard drive.

Apple persuaded the U.S. government to use everything it could against the Brazilian clone makers (increases in import taxes for brazilian products such as orange juice, shoes, etc.) until this machine was no longer made.\nBrazil had a tradition since the beginning of the 80's of cloning computers without permission from the original brand owners (see the lawsuit moved by Sinclair against Microdigital). Apple had so far tolerated brazilian clones of the Apple II, but not this time...\nThere were differences between this machine and genuine Macs: Some of Unitron's macs had keyboards with black keys, some others had grey keys. Some versions had a disc drive with a button to eject the disc, others were like the original Mac and had no button in its disc drive.\nThe end of making Brazilian Mac clones may have been not good for Apple in the long run since it opened the doors of Brazilian market to PC clones that didn't have such restrictions.\nThanks to <b>Ernesto Hublard<\/b> from Brazil for information.",

        "description": "The Commodore 64C was simply the original <a href=\"computer.asp?c=98\">C-64<\/a>  repackaged in in a beige <a href=\"computer.asp?c=96\">C-128<\/a> style case. Internally, Commodore integrated most of the hardware onto a single VLSI chip. \nThe new model did not differ much from its predecessor, the only innovation was the flatter case, which made the keyboard (which had off-white keys) more ergonomic (it looked like the C128 case), not as high as than the old one. But the new case did not only have advantages: due to its low profile and additional metal screening, some of the numerous hardware expansions did not fit anymore. This was changed with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1136\">C64G<\/a>.\nThe official name for this model was \"C=64 C\", but nevertheless the German 64'er magazine decided to call it \"C64-II\" (because the first units didn't have the new name on the label at the bottom), the badges on most of the 64 C's just says \"Commodore 64\". They pointed out that this name was only valid for the 64'er magazine, but since the 64'er was the magazine for the C64 for a long time, the name was widely accepted and so this model is mostly known as \"C64-II\" in Germany. \nCommodore took advantage of the launch of the 64C to improve its range of peripherals. The machine could be delivered with:\n? the <b>1541C<\/b> disk drive, internally the same as the previous 1541, but with a beige case,\n? the <b>1541-II<\/b> disk drive, a smaller 1541 with external power supply and a beige case\n? The <b>1351<\/b> two-button mouse which could operate in either proportional or joystick mode,\n? The <b>1802<\/b> color monitor which accepted both composite and RGB video signals,\n? The <b>1764<\/b> RAM expander which plugged into the expansion port and boosted the system RAM to 256 KB.\nFirst 64C were bundled with <b>GEOS<\/b>, developed by Berkeley Software, a good window and icon opating system, considering that it ran on a 8-bit processors and 64 KB of RAM.\nSadly, the 64C was launched at the wrong time, at a wrong price (about $80 more than the C64). At that time the competition was hard with the new <a href=\"computer.asp?c=20\">Atari<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=28\">Amiga<\/a> 32-bit computers. The 64C thus didn't meet a large success, except in some European countries.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=998\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

While its\nancestor, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=987\">FX-702P<\/a>, was still called \"Programmable Calculator\",\nthe PB-100 proudly bears the title \"Personal Computer\".\nHowever, the PB-100 seems to have been a true low-cost design. Its\nspecifications are clearly inferior to those of its predecessor, the FX-702P, as\nwell as to SHARP's earlier pockets. The limited 12 character display makes BASIC programming and debugging a painstaking endeavor.\nIn its standard version, it is equipped with 1 KB of RAM which results in only 544 bytes for BASIC, which is really limiting. At least, with the memory module OR-1, it can be upgraded to 1568 bytes of user memory, so it begins to make sense that BASIC memory can be subdivided into 10 independent program areas P0-P9.  \nMoreover, the keyboard had been reduced to the absolute minimum; at any rate, it provided a QWERTY style layout (the FX-702P had a non-standard alphabetical layout).\nOn the other hand, the cute little machine is really small and lightweight, a\nreal pocket device.\nThe main circuits of the PB-100 are basically made up of two chips. Processor\nlogics, ROM, display driver, and keyboard controller are integrated in a single\nCMOS VLSI chip HD61913, which has an external 4-bit bus. The second main\ncomponent is a HD61914, which is a 8192-bit static RAM organized as 2048 words\nby 4 bits.\nIn 1983, the PB-100 was also released by Tandy Radio Shack as <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1003\">TRS-80\nPC-4<\/a> and by Olympia as <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1001\">OP-544<\/a>.\nThanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\">retrocomputing.ch<\/a>) for this information.",

        "description": "The Interact computer had a very short life in USA. It had only just got in production when the Interact Co. of Ann Arbor MI, went bankrupt. Several thousand machines were produced though. Some of them were sold by Protecto Enterprizes of Barrington, IL, the liquidator, but the main part was sold by MicroVideo, also of Ann Arbor. Protecto bought lots of back-of-the-magazine ads for years, always printed with \"WE LOVE OUR CUSTOMERS\".\nThe Interact shipped with 2 joysticks, a built-in tape recorder, a TV RF modulator and 2 KB of ROM. Everything, including BASIC, must be loaded from tape. A little trivia: The tape unit did include an erase head, but it was not connected! Tapes had to be erased on a regular cassette recorder before being reused. Another surprising feature is that the \"1\" key is after the \"0\" key at the far right of the keyboard. Thus the row is starting from 2 and finishing by 1... See explanation in the \"Read more\" page. \nMicroVideo supported the machine for two years, 1979-80, making some hardware expansions (32K RAM card and stringy floppy drive), replacing the original minimalist EDU-BASIC language with a Microsoft 8K graphic version, and even publishing 3 issues of 'Interaction', a newsletter of the Detroit Interact Group.\nThe Interact computer finally vanished from the US market in late 1980. However, a French company bought the rights of the machine and started to sell the Interact under <b>Victor Lambda<\/b> name in French market. See the rest of the story <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/museum\/doc.asp?c=151\">here<\/a>.\nFor five years, several improved sequels of the Interact, called <b>Hector<\/b>, were launched in France. The last version, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=169\">Hector MX<\/a>, featured high resolution graphics and 4 built-in languages!\n<strong>If you got tapes for the Interact or Victor Lambda (or Hector\/Victor), please contact us.

        "description": "The Mac Portable was Apple's first attempt to produce a portable version of a desktop Macintosh computer. The machine was partially engineered by Alan Kay (designer of the Dynabook), and was the first laptop computer with a GUI interface, along with <a href=\"computer.asp?c=225\">Atari Stacy<\/a>.\nApple launched the Mac Portable at the same time as the Mac IIci.  This marketing tactic could be considered questionable given the fact that the IIci featured a 68030 processor running at 25 MHz while the Portable version offered a 68000 (in actual fact, a low-power 68HC000) running at 16 MHz.\nThis is likely the reason that Portable sales never reached the volume that Apple was hoping for; this despite the fact that the machine was twice as fast as a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=161\">Mac SE<\/a> and nearly as fast as a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=160\">Mac II<\/a>.\nDespite its weight, the Mac Portable was well-designed.  It featured an advanced active-matrix LCD screen, up to 9 MB of SRAM, a 1.44MB floppy disk drive and an optional 40MB 3.5-inch hard disk drive.  Its lead-acid battery -- responsible for most of the machine's weight -- offered 8 to 10 hours of autonomy which was quite an achievement at that time.\n18 months after the Portable was first launched, Apple replaced the LCD screen with a backlit version, replaced the SRAM chips with less expensive versions, and offered a lower retail price.  The machine was eventually discontinued six months later, but the system icon made for this computer became the icon for all Mac portables for several years to come.\nNote also that the Macintosh Portable was used in space, not without some problems...

        "description": "The CD-i 210 was a stripped down version of the CD-i 220, lacking the chique opening door in front of the tray. Also, its FTD-display was slightly less sophisticated. Several versions of the CD-i 210 have been produced, each with minor differences (shell version, digital video cartridge compatibility model, CD loading mechanism version, etc). But the CD-i 210 is nowadays certainly the most common CD-i system found worldwide.\nThe CD-i 210 is thus part of the big CD-i family. CD-i is short for Compact Disc Interactive. It is an interactive multimedia system combining moving and still video, audio and program content on a compact disc, which can be played back in a dedicated CD-i player.\nCD-i was jointly developed by Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corporation in the mid 80s. Together, both companies defined CD-i's basic specifications in what is know as the Green Book. They decided to use the well-tested OS-9 operating system from Microware Systems Corporation, which was designed for embedded, real-time applications. Microware was also heavily involved in the CD-i design process. Eventually, Philips took the biggest part in the development process, being responsible for at least 90% of CD-i's development.\nThe basic CD-i specification allows a CD-i player to display full screen animations in 128 colors over a 16.7 million color background, or play partial screen moving video in a lower framerate in 16.7 million colors, both with accompanying sound. However, these capabilities are extended when a Digital Video cartridge is placed in the player. In this case, the player is able to display full-screen, full moving 30 fps video in 16.7 million colors according to the MPEG-1 standard. Although Digital Video is not a part of CD-i's basic specification, it is generally considered to be a \"must-have\" extension to a CD-i player since it adds an enormous audiovisual performance boost to the system.\nA Base Case CD-i player should be able to decode standard PCM audio as specified for CD-Audio, as well as a dedicated audio coding scheme called ADPCM, or Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation. A CD-i player equiped with a Digital Video cartridge is also able to decode MPEG-1 layer I and II audio.\nCD-i can display both main planes in either normal, double or high resolution, which are 384x280, 768x280 and 768x560 respectively. CD-i highest resolution (768x560), used for QHY images, is the highest resolution that can be made visible on a normal TV set, so CD-i takes TV-technology to its edges.\nNote that there are no system performance differences between the various players. Although there are various models of CD-i players, every CD-i disc will perform exactly the same in terms of system speed or audio and video quality on every CD-i system.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n__________\nInfo compiled from the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icdia.org\/faq\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CD-i FAQ 2000 Edition<\/a>.

        "description": "Action Max from Worlds of Wonder (WoW), released in the US in 1987, was a unique, if simple and ultimately unimpressive game system that used special pre-recorded VHS video tapes for software.  The original package came bundled with the base unit, light gun, television sensor, headphones, connection cables, documentation and one game, \"Sonic Fury\".  Batteries or a power supply were not included.  After connecting the components to the base unit and the base unit to any standard VCR, the player inserted the videotape game into the VCR and pressed 'play'.  After minimal video instruction, the target sensor was placed on the appropriate spot on the television's screen via the included suction cup.  A short target practice scenario was displayed, then the game began, with the target sensor glowing red every time a hit was registered, keeping count on the base unit.\nInteraction was strictly one way.  There was no reaction from the video when a target, be it a plane, ghost or some other enemy, was hit, so gameplay was a purely linear experience, with the footage rolling unimpeded as long as 'stop' was not pressed on the VCR's controls or the end of the tape was reached.  As for the quality of the videos themselves, the special effects were laughable and what little there was in regards to acting was amateurish at best.  Since the base unit could receive signals but not output them, a small speaker was built-in to generate simple sound effects.  This sound could be disabled or bypassed with the headphones.\nThree game modes could be selected: 'Standard', 'Reflex' and 'Limited Ammunition'. On the console itself there were dials to adjust interal sound volume and player distance from the display. There were also switches to choose game type ('Normal', 'Special'), players ('First', 'Second') and to turn the system on or Off. \nSo what were the system's failings?  Due to the linear nature of the games, targets appeared in the same places every single time, making memorization of \"enemy\" locations a real issue. While the system had three game variations and play for alternating gamers, it was nothing more than a fancy target game, no matter which videotape was utilized. Interestingly, at the end of each videotape \"game\", there were video previews of other releases, which also had targets and could be shot at and scored, acting like a (unintentional?) demo! \nWoW was most famous for its \"Teddy Ruxpin\" line of animated dolls and \"Laser Tag\" action game. WoW was also the original distributor of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the US. Eventually, Nintendo's market presence became so great that the company decided to handle distribution and store relations without WoW's assistance. The Action Max then was WoW's ill-fated attempt to re-enter the videogame market with a device that was more toy than videogame.  Interestingly, after the company's collapse due to a glut of unbought toys, some of its former employees went to work for Nintendo. \nNOTE: If you want to buy one of these units from auction sites, the format for the VHS tapes is NTSC, which does not work in many International territories.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n___________________\nThanks to Bill Loguidice for text correction and most of the info.<\/font>",

        "description": "APF TV Fun Model 401 is a classic pong system. It is one of the first system based on the common AY-3-8500 chipset from General Instruments. Thus, it offers four basic pong games : tennis, hockey, squash and single handball.\nThe case is quite nice with woodgrain style finish and silver-like knobs, switches and buttons... Switches are used to turn the system on and off, select game option and service mode (auto\/manual). Buttons are used to reset the system and serve the ball. Game selection is made through a small dial in the middle of the control panel.\nThe controllers are built-in the case. These are two dials placed on both sides of the case. The RF cable is built into the unit, but it's possible to unplug it from the insides of the machine for replacement. The system can be powered by six C-size batteries or by an external power supply.\nThe TV Fun model 401 is not to be mistaken with later APF models which used the same case. There are TV Fun Model 401A and TV Fun Sportsarama.",

        "description": "When the Nimbus PC series was launched, Research Machines already had a long history of providing innovative and reliable computers for the British education market.\nThe Nimbus PC was also intended to support schools in the use of the computers. It wasn't a pale copy of a standard PC but a fast and versatile DOS machine entirely designed and manufactured by RM.\nThe basic machine held 192 KB of RAM,  a single 720 KB floppy drive and extended sound and graphics. It could be expanded to 1 MB of RAM,  dual floppy drives and up to 160 MB hard disk. The Nimbus was also designed as a network station and came with built-in Piconet and ethernet ports.\nThe Nimbus ran a modified version of Microsoft MS-DOS 3.10 that could not run on a standard PC. Sadly, this was quite a limitation. Although an IBM emulator software allowed some standard PC programs to run, only software specifically written for the Nimbus was able to take advantage of the improved sound and graphic features. However, RM and  third-parties released numerous languages and educational software that fulfilled most school needs.\nA special x86 version of BBC Basic also allowed a wide range of programs written for Acorn machines to be run. To note also that some Nimbus software would run on a standard PC, for example the Nimbus versions MS Word and Multiplan.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1011\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

To our knowledge, Casio was the only company who\ndesigned real pocket size computers with integrated printers.\nOf course, the PB-300 was substantially larger than its elder brother, therefore the keyboard could be laid out more generously, with a real space bar and an additional key for paper feed.\nDue to the different physical dimensions, the main PCB had a different layout.\nHowever, the logic circuits were identical to the PB-100, with an additional\nHD61914 RAM chip. No further RAM expansion was made available.\nAs printers needed much more energy than the computer components, a 4 x 1.2V NiCad battery pack had to be integrated, which needed to be charged with an external power adaptor. The necessary printer and battery charging circuits were built onto a second PCB.\nThe printer used thermal paper of 39 mm width and was able to print 20 characters per line, making printed listings a little bit more legible than on the 12-character display.\nTo sum up, the PB-300 was a really cute machine. Imagine taking it with you in 1983 and impressing your friends by printing business cards when needed. \nThe PB-300 was also sold in Europe under the name Olympia <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/museum\/photos.asp?t=1&amp;c=1001&amp;st=1\">OP-644<\/a>.\nThanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\">retrocomputing.ch<\/a>) for information and pictures.",

        "description": "In April 1994, Acorn announced the release of the second generation of ARM machines ? the Acorn RISC PC 600. Code named the <b>Medusa<\/b> project, this was set to replace the then ailing flagship <a href=\"computer.asp?c=710\">A5000<\/a> machine.\nAs the name suggests, one of the main features of this computer was that it could run both Acorn and IBM-PC software side by side. This was achieved by a second CPU slot that could accept a daughter board with a PC CPU, such as a 486 or 586. This second processor then had shared access with the primary CPU to all the system resources. No more CPU intensive software PC emulation required!\nAs well as the second processor, other major enhancements included an updated video controller with the option for dedicated video RAM. The graphics chip in previous Archimedes range machines had shared the system memory with the rest of the computer which often proved to be a bottle neck without true DMA. Now the video controller could have video memory of it?s own, removing the bottle neck. \nThe system data bus was doubled in size to 32bits wide, and the MEMU and IOC chips were combined to create the IOMD20. This resulted in much better overall I\/O, yet another bottle neck removed from previous machines. The system memory was also upgraded to a maximum of 256MB and the memory bus was designed to use the more widely available EDO SIMM?s.\nA unique feature of the RISC PC was its case. This came in the form of the base holding the motherboard and power supply, a mid section for mounting one 3.5\" device, one 5.25\" device and two single width expansion cards, and then a lid. The magic was that you could add up to 8 slices at any time, giving you a very easily expandable computer, and all held together with clips and springs negating the need for a screwdriver. Very neat.\nThere were 2 other Acorn RISC PC's. The RISC <b>PC 700<\/b> was released July 1995 and the RISC <b>PC-2<\/b> was much publicised by Acorn and then dramatically cancelled at the last minute.\nThanks to <b>Paul Hadfield<\/b> for his kind help.",

        "description": "Vectrex is one of the most inspired video game machines ever produced. Its point\nof distinction is the fact that it uses vector \"line\" graphics (as opposed to raster \"pixel\" graphics).  This is the same type of screen used in such arcade classics as Space Wars, Asteroids, Battlezone and Tempest.\nThe machine has a 9 x 11 inch black and white screen and comes with a built-in Asteroids clone called Minestorm.  The games come with plastic overlays that slide over the screen to cut down on flicker and give some illusion of color.\nIt uses an 8 bit processor, the 68A09 (6809 with 1.5MHz clock speed), and a popular (at that time) sound chip, General Instruments AY-3-8912, which can produce a wide range of noises.  Also included is a 1.5 inch, self-centering,\njoystick with 4 buttons on the right.  It uses an analog\/potentiometer system allowing differing degrees of directional input.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n__________\nSource : Vectrex FAQ<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1018\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

The MASTER-UCB module contained the 8080 microprocessor, an 8 KB EPROM memory, the 8224 clock circuit, the 8228 local bus command circuit and the 8259 interrupt circuit.\nAn example of slave module was the printer \/ card puncher-reader port, wich didn't access the system's bus.\nThe first M18 contained the URS-80.00 main unit and 4 cards (CPU, SYU, PF, EBUS) for EPROM and RAM memory, and the necessary interfaces to connect the following peripherals:  console, paper tape reader\/puncher, serial printer, punched cards reader, magnetic tape drive and magnetic casette drive.\nThe Felix M18B had improved modules. The main UCB unit  had the memory resources and the interrupts system on a single card. The 32 KB RAM module also was on a single card.\nThe systems could run three base software packs:\n1 - <b>M18-ROS<\/b>, Resident Operating System,\n2 - <b>M18-TOS<\/b>, Operating system oriented on punched paper tapes and magnetic tapes,\n3 - <b>SFDX18<\/b>, an enhanced version of the M18-ROS and M18-TOS wich contained a monitor (MON18 V1.3), the command interpretor, an I\/O subsystem, a supervisor (editor, libraries, linker), and various languages: ASM80 macroassembler, PLM80, FORTRAN80, COBOL80, BASIC, PASCAL80.\nThe CP\/M OS was adapted later, as well as a cross-software pack (M18-CSP) allowing software to be written and simulated on the Felix C-256 family before being transferred to a M18 system through punch cards or magnetic tapes. \nThe M18 series was manufactured in large series and also sold beyond Romania.\nThe Central Informatic research Institute of Romania (ICI) also wrote a succesful real-time OS for the M18, as well as an Ethernet-like local network called CAMELEON.\nThanks to <b>Stefan Deli<\/b> from Romania for information and pictures.",

        "description": "The Konix multisystem console, also known as the Konix slipstream, was a joint development between 2 british businesses, Flare Technology and Konix.  Konix were on a high in 1988 after the success of their Joystick range and well known through gaming channels. Flare Technology was formed by 3 ex-Sinclair engineers, all of whome were involved in the aborted Loki \"Super Spectrum\", which was shelved after Sinclair sold the computer division to Amstrad.  Not wanting their work to be wasted, they formed their own company to bring the idea into the real world.\nFlare first developed the RAM Music Machine for the Spectrum, this used some of the ideas from Loki's sound subsystem to make a synthesizer\/sampler add on\nfor the speccy, and generated a revenue to fund development of the Flare 1 computer system.  The Flare 1 was based around the Z80 processor, had a BLiTTER\nchip, 4096 colour palette, advanced 16bit sound system (8 voices) and graphics modes which rivaled the Amiga, all thanks to the custom processors within the system. This specification was very similar to the Loki, which as far as we know, never left the drawing board (Or did it?).\nIn 1988, Flare had a working Flare 1 board with all custom chips fully working, but they did not have the means to put it into production. An article in Persomal Computer World that year, gave a climpse of what this super machine could do. The graphics demo's were astounding, even as photographs. Flare 1\nhad something the Amiga lacked, the ability to do 3D polygons in the graphics subsystem (The Amiga had to do this with the CPU, just like the ST). As a result of the article, Flare and Konix got together for a meeting, and the multisystem was announced to the public a few weeks later.\nThe multisystem was really the Flare 1, but replaced the 8 bit Z80 with a 16 bit 8086. It was to be released in 1989 at a price point of 200 pounds, with a range of additional hardware being made available soon after. This included hydrolic chairs, light pens\/guns and a whole range of additional controllers. The system never saw the light of day. Constant modifications to the case design, adding of storage devices (such as the floppy disk) caused delay after delay.  \nEventually Konix folded and Flare Technology designed the Flare 2, an improvement on the origional Flare 1 machine, which would eventually be the starting point for <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1224\">Atari's Jaguar console<\/a>.\nSomehow, the system was later sold as the <b>MSC Multi System<\/b>! In fact it used the same cosmetic design but was only a controller for IBM PC compatible systems (and maybe some other type of computers), with no specific electronic hardware inside. This super controller (driving, moto and flying modes) was also marketed as the <b>Pearl Multi-Spiele-Konsole<\/b> in Germany.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n____________\nText and info by Malcolm Ramage.<\/font>",

Silex means flint in french, a stone mainly used in prehistoric times as tools and weapons.\nThe SILEX is a professional computer released in 1979 by the french company Leanord. It was conceived from a modified Apple II board.\nIt has a professional keyboard with function keypad and numeric keypad. The display is built-in the system. It is monochrome but has graphic capabilities (280 x 192) and can display 40 x 24 characters (80 x 24 in option). To the right of the display is a 5.25'' disk-drive built-in the case (143 KB). Additional storage media will be available later (high density disk drives and hard disks).\nDifferent languages were available : extended BASIC (in english and in french!), PASCAL, \"evoluated disk operating system\"...\nThe fact that there is so little information about the Silex, makes us believe that it had a very short life, at least under this name, since <a href=\"computer.asp?c=209\">SIL'Z systems<\/a> from the same company seem to be an evolution of the Silex.

        "description": "In 1963, engineers at the <i>Institut f?r Maschinelle Rechentechnik<\/i> (institute for machine computation technology) in Dresden, GDR (ex-Eastern Germany) finished the <b>D4a<\/b>. The D4a had been developed on the basis of the <i>Kleinrechenautomat Dresden 1<\/i> (D1) from 1956. The system was then manufactured by the <i>VEB B?romaschinenwerk Zella-Mehlis<\/i> in three versions, under the name <b>Cellatron 8201<\/b>, <b>8205<\/b>, and <b>8295 Z<\/b>. About 3000 exemplars were produced. The D4a is seen as the <b>first PC of the GDR<\/b>.\nBy the way, VEB is short for <i>Volkseigener Betrieb<\/i> and means as much as \"factory belonging to the people\".\nThe <b>C 8205<\/b> central unit was comprised of the <i>Leitwerk<\/i> (instruction counter, instruction register, and address decoder), the <i>Rechenwerk<\/i> (accumulator and math operations), and the <i>Trommelspeicher<\/i> (magnetic drum memory). The former two subsystems were realised as discrete circuits including approximately 400 transistors and 2000 diodes. \nWorking memory was realised with a magnetic drum memory providing 4096 words\nof 33 bits. Moreover, the system was comprised of a command desk with keyboard, lamp array for displaying operational states, switches for locking certain tracks of the drum memory, two paper tape readers and one puncher, and a typewriter-like printer. It needed about 9 sqm space in an air conditioned and noise insulated room. Power consumption was 1500 VA.\nThe system could be programmed in pure machine code, or in interpreted pseudo-code using a program called <b>GIPS I<\/b>, <i>Gleitkomma-Interpretationssystem einfacher Wortl?nge<\/i>, i.e. floating point interpretation system with single word length. It simulates floating point arithmetics as well as a number of pseudo data registers. The GIPS I interpreter had to be read into memory before use.\nMoreover, it was possible to program the system in <b>PS 2<\/b>, which probably meant <i>programming language 2<\/i>. It was developed by VEB engineers. This language implemented various data types, mathematical operations, I\/O commands, and control statements equivalent to GOTO, IF...THEN GOTO, labels, subroutines, and FOR-loops. The source program had first to be punched on paper tape, and then compiled. As the PS 2 compiler occupied the complete memory, the resulting object code (in GIPS I format) was immediately punched out on paper tape. After that, the object code could be read and run with the GIPS I interpreter in memory.\nThe picture shows the C 8205 model.\nThanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\">site<\/a> for information and pictures.",

But it was also a real micro-computer with a tape interface to save and load programs, and a S-100 compatible expansion bus.\nIt actually belonged to a second generation training computers: unlike its predecessors, it wasn't just a raw electronic board, but offered a real plastic case, S-100 bus, tape-interface, etc....\nThe built-in display was only a eight-digit, seven-segment LED display... When turned on it displays \"HELLO\". The keyboard was made of an hexadecimal keypad (16 keys) and function keypad (12 keys). Interaction is also made through 8 parallel I\/O switches and their corresponding LEDs.\nThe only software built-in the system was the monitor (called User System Executive or USE), used to program the Instructor 50. Of course, programmation was made in hexadecimal through a simplistic assembler.\nThe 2 KB ROM was used to store the monitor. RAM was 640 bytes, but 128 bytes were used by the monitor, leaving 512 bytes for programmation. But having 14 address lines, the 2650 CPU was capable of addressing 32K bytes !",

        "description": "The P2000 desktop series was the first Philips attempt to penetrate the home computer market. It was released in March 1980 in two version, the P2000M and the P2000T. \nThe main difference lied in the video interface. The T version, aimed at home and educational use, could be connected to either a standard TV set or a special RGB monitor. The M version, more professional, had an additional 80-column card allowing to connect a monochrome composite monitor. This version shipped with a monitor cabinet also housing a dual 5.25\" floppy drive.\nThe P2000 was a robust and well conceived machine. There was no built-in language but only a 4 KB ROM holding system basic and I\/O routines. Two cartridges slots allowed to add ROM programs (slot 1) or interface cards (slot 2) like a modem or a parallel printer interface.\nPrograms and data could be stored through the built-in mini cassette drive which was seen by the user as a floppy drive  with automatic search for a program (CLOAD command) or free space (CSAVE). A command also allowed to display the directory of a cassette tape.\nThe P2000 didn't meet a great success in Europe, except in the Netherlands, its country of origin (although the machine was made in Austria) where the very active Philips user group provided lots of original software and hardware extensions like CP\/M or disk drive controller cards. The P2000 was also widely used in Dutch and German schools.\n<b>J. Frijling<\/b> (Netherlands) reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The P2000 was initially meant for office use. Since a lot of other manufactures made home computers, Philips desided to put it on the home computer market. By the graphics you can see that it is a professional computer. If you wanted to do other than graphics, this was a powerful computer. Back then, this computer had already a RS232!! A novelty in those days. Because of that, it was widly used in the HAM-radio and hobby circuits.\nThe 1st model came out with 16kb. You could add another 16kb as an internal extensionboard. Later came 64kb, although for basic you could only use 40kb, 64, 80 and 102kb. Above 40kb you could use it for bankswitching.\nThe best part of all was that everything was protected by buffers, unlike the Commodore, who could easily be damged when wron connected! Unfortunatly the majority went for the better graphics.\nLater major improvements were made such as Highres graphics, inbuild 720kb FDD for model T, memory extension &amp; lots more.

It was the first mac using a 10\" (9\" viewable) colour monitor (Sony CRT) and the last of the original all-in-one Macintosh line to be sold in the US market. \nIts main board had the same design as the Mac LC II, featuring a 16 MHz 68030 CPU. Sadly, its address bus was limited to 16 bit and allowed only 10 MB of maximum RAM.\nThe Color Classic could emulate the Apple II thank to an expansion card inserted into its PDS slot.\nAn improved version, called <b>Color Classic II<\/b> (aka Performa 275) was launched in late 1993 in Canada then in Japan. It had the same motherboard as the LC\/Performa 550 with a 33 MHz CPU, a 32-bit bus and up to 36 MB of available RAM.\nSome people call the LC\/Performa 550 the \"Fat Color Classic II\" because of the wider monitor.\n____________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Jeremy Dilatush<\/b> adds:\nThis machine's color graphics were *slow* so I usually ran mine in black and white mode.  Yes, it made a major difference.<\/font>\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Gwion Mainwaring<\/b> reports:\nThere are PPC Upgrades available and this will make your Color Classic a lot faster so you could run Mac OS 8 or 9.

        "description": "Kaypro's loyalty to customers was legendary.  In fact, its refusal to abandon CP\/M users dangerously delayed its adoption of the DOS Operating System.  Nevertheless, it eventually acceded and was one of the last US manufacturer to introduce a PC compatible system simply named the <b>Kaypro PC<\/b>\nIt was most affordable package in the IBM-compatible world including a CAD-capable Samsung monitor and ATI video card capable of Hercules graphics, CGA color, and CGA color emulation on a monochrome monitor.  The entry machine was faster than its IBM PC-XT rival.  Typically, it was a rugged, dependable desktop PC that immediately out-classed IBM in additional areas by including larger and faster standard hard drives, generous free software combinations, and top-flight ring-bound user documentation.\nStill in 1985 came the Kaypro <b>286i<\/b>, the very first available PC\/AT-compatible system, faster at the same clock speed than the IBM model, it was quickly revised with Intel's latest chip, the 8MHz 286, running over 30% faster than IBM's offering.  \nKaypro engineered its own high quality motherboards and introduced upgradable processors in desktop PCs, mounting the computer?s microprocessor on a replaceable expansion card instead of on the expensive motherboard; thus facilitating easy, lower-cost replacement of the processor.\nKaypro pioneered advanced memory usage, managing to squeeze out an additional 128 KB in the first megabyte of standard DOS memory, thus giving users access to the full 728 KB of DOS memory instead of the 640 KB allowed on other systems.  This extra memory was available as a fast virtual drive for active data files, greatly speeding computing performance.\nIn a time when full IBM-compatibility was more often marketing hype than hard reality, Kaypro went beyond the rest of the industry and backed its PCs with the only money-back guarantee of FULL IBM-compatibility.  The PC was so good that Kaypro even guaranteed to buy a dissatisfied customer a replacement from IBM if they desired.\nSpec. board is for the 286i version - Thanks to <b>Dennis<\/b> for the pictures.",

The file names were the same as in CMS, \"filename (8). extension (8): drive (1)\"\nYou could connect two or more networked computers using the RS232 serial output in a ring topology.

The model was a BC12-FD, we paid around about ?5000 for each machine.\nThese systems came with Macro, Basic(compiled and interpreted versions, Assembler, word processing software and Fortran. There were single disk and dual floppy disk versions, ours both had dual disks. These systems were very nice to work with, the Word Processor capability was excellent and so simple to use, it used the function keys extensively to toggle on\/off bold\/italics\/underlining etc.\nWe bought them to complement a PDP8 and an Intersil Intercept Junior (256 bytes of RAM, 4 * 7 Segment LED Display) coupled to an ASR33 Teletype with punch paper reader\/writer, which we were using to develop ground test software.\nWe were to have integrated these systems into a ground station for downloading data from a flight recorder, but unfortunately technology advances caused us to buy WICAT WS150 systems and then these were replaced by Tektronix 8560?s (PDP 11\/23 inside) which survived for many years before being replaced by a laptop. \nUnfortunately the Billings BC12-FD?s were put in the skip along with the WICAT, shortly before I was able to rescue them when our factory shut in 1992.

        "description": "? First real-time computer,\n? First computer with a graphic display,\n? First computer using core memory,\n? First electronic computer not built as a replacement for a\nmechanical system.\nThe project that led to the building of the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Whirlwind computer was a Navy contract during World War II, aimed at creating a real-time flight simulator with a graphics display simulating the aircraft control panel. Jay Forrester, the project lead, first tried building an analog computer for the task, but concluded that it could not provide the necessary accuracy in the aerodynamics model. Jerry Crawford, who saw the ENIAC demonstrated in 1945, suggested that they build a digital computer instead. The design was completed in 1947, and construction started with a team of 175 people, including 70 technical staff.\nWhirlwind went live on April 20, 1951. By this time the Navy had lost interest, since the Whirlwind was not going to be fast enough for their training system, but the Air Force took their place, funding Whirlwind development under Project Claude.\nProcessor speed was initially 20 KIPS  (Thousands of Instructions Per Second), limited primarily by the access time of the Williams-Kilburn CRT storage tube used for main memory. It stored bits in the form of activated phosphor dots on the screen, reading and refreshing them before the dots faded. Each dot could be read due to the charge on the face of the tube. The tubes could be operated on a 4-step cycle, synchronized with the 4-step instruction processing cycle. Except during the Fetch Instruction step, a memory operation and a separate instruction process would be carried out simultaneously\n? Refresh a line;  increment instruction pointer\n? Fetch instruction\n? Refresh next line; decode instruction\n? Random Access Read\/Write; execute instruction\nThe original MIT Whirlwind filled four floors of a two-story building, counting the megawatt power substation in the basement and the HVAC system on the roof that had to extract all of that heat. The processor was built from 18,000 vacuum tubes drawing about 50 watts each. When the tube racks were fully powered up, it was not safe to walk between them due to the heat they gave off.\nEvery day, the first task after turning on the power was for someone to check the tube racks and replace any burned-out \ntubes. Then a program entered on a bank of toggle switches in binary machine language could be run. The length of time between tube burnouts was the limiting factor on the length of programs that could be run. When external storage was added, the toggle switches were kept in a boot loader program, effectively acting as system ROM.\nThe most famous program written for the Whirlwind I was the bouncing ball routine, which showed the correct gravitational arc, and loss of energy on each bounce. A straight line represented the ground or the floor. Leaving out a segment of this line where the ball came down would cause the ball to continue falling off the bottom of the screen.\nThe invention of core memory, which is inherently faster and does not require refreshing, allowed Whirlwind to run at 40 KIPS starting in 1953. This was fast enough for the Air Force SAGE (Semi Automated Ground Environment) air defense system. The contract to manufacture production versions of Whirlwind was initially given to RCA, and then to IBM. System design was done by the MITRE Corporation, an MIT spinoff, and Western Electric?s Air Defense Engineering Service (ADES) got the system integration contract.\nThanks to <b>Edward Cherlin<\/b>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryze.com\/go\/Cherlin\" target=\"_blank\">Simputer Evangelist<\/a>, for all this information.\nEdward's father, George Yale Cherlin, Ph.D., worked on programming the original Whirlwind I as a graduate student in 1951, contributing to the famous Bouncing Ball program.\nPicture from <a href=\"&lt;a%20href=\" http: target=\"_blank\">www.cedmagic.com<\/a>",

        "description": "What a weird system ! After their <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=733\">Combat Lunaire<\/a>, Stellar Electronique announced a brand new and revolutionary system : Micromat, also named \"micro-ordinateur de jeux, fonctions universelles\", i.e. \"gaming micro-computer, universal fonctions\". What a program ! It seems to be an original mix between a check board gaming system, a micro-computer and a video-game system !!\nThe system uses almost the same plastic case as the Combat Lunaire system, though it is black here. There is a check board built-in the case used to play checkerboard games like tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess, etc. All moves of a game session can be saved on tape, and reloaded to finish it !\nBut games can also be loaded from cartridge, tape and even vinyl records ! The system can be connected to a TV to play video games, though there is a built-in display (8 digits, 14 segments)... There are sound features but specs are unknown.\nInteraction is made through a knob and fire switch (button?) built-in the part of the system. There is also a 18 keys keypad next to the checkboard. Games listed in the press release were : tic-tac-toe, checker, chess, bridge, lunar landing, star war, chess, go... The system is described as \"the first universal mini-computer of great power mainly aimed at games\".\nIt is not clear if this system was ever released, but it was for sure a very original and interesting object !",

        "description": "The AN\/FSQ-7 was by far the largest computer ever built, and is \nexpected to hold that record. It consisted of two complete <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1047\">Whirlwind II<\/a> computers installed in a 4-story building (See the impressive diagram in the 'More Pictures' section).\nEach AN\/FSQ supported more than 100 users. IBM had about 60 employees \nat each site for round-the-clock maintenance.\nKeeping one unit operating and one on hot standby (to allow for \nswitchover when vacuum tubes failed) resulted in better than 99% \nuptime. The roles of the two units were reversed at regular \nintervals, allowing diagnostics and maintenance to be carried \nout on the standby unit.\nThere were usually several hundred tube failures each day, \nreplaced by workers racing up and down the tube racks with \nshopping carts full of replacements. Automated tests run by the \ncomputer itself would cycle the voltage to the tube racks down \nand back up to induce marginal tubes to fail early, so that the \ncomputer would normally run correctly for the rest of the day. \nWithout this process, the MTBF would have been a few minutes. \nBy the time SAGE was deployed (22 or 23 stations in the period \n1959-1963; sources disagree) it was nearly obsolete, since it \nwas designed to detect bombers, not the new ICBMs. Nevertheless \nit was operational until 1979, when the ROCC (Regional \nOperations Control Centers) system took over, using much \nhigher-speed computers. One SAGE station continued operating \nuntil 1983. This last unit was donated to the Boston Computing \nMuseum, since relocated to Moffett Field in Mountain View, \nCalifornia. The museum also has a tube panel from the Whirlwind \nI. Whirlwind II consoles turned up in the TV series <i>Battlestar \nGalactica<\/i>.\n<be>\nIn spite of its limited military value, the SAGE system served as \nan excellent prototype for an air-traffic control system. The \nFAA operated its own AN\/FSQ-7 systems for many years after SAGE \nwas shut down. IBM's experience with these systems had a great \ndeal to do with its later success in computer systems, and its \ndominance of the market for large computers. The IBM 7090 was \nessentially a solid-state version of the AN\/FSQ-7\/8. (The 7090 \nhas its own rich history, including hosting the first-ever \nmultiuser APL system.)\n? First CRT-based real-time user interface,\n? First use of light gun to pick an item on the screen,\n? First wide-area modem communications (1300 bps),\n? First hot standby system for maximum uptime,\n? First ground control of interceptor aircraft,\n? The first in line microfilm fast processed 35 mm projection displays, preceding printer\/plotters. A screen capture could be displayed within 30 seconds,\n? First two-pass assembler, permitting symbolic addresses.\nThanks to <b>Edward Cherlin<\/b>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryze.com\/go\/Cherlin\" target=\"_blank\">Simputer Evangelist<\/a>, for all this information.\nThe photo (from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mitre.org\/about\/photo_archives\/sage_photo.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mitre<\/a>) shows the rear panel wiring of FSQ-7 arithmetic element frame.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1050\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>\n\t\n<\/be>",

        "description": "What a funky system ! This is a french system, made in Toulouse, south of France. Soci?t? Occitane d'El?ctronique often released systems (pongs, consoles and computers) with original 70's cosmetic design.\nIt is software compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> and \"clones\". This doesn't mean that it can use the Interton cartridges, as they won't fit, but the internal specs and software are the same. The CPU is the 2650A from Signetics and the Video Controller is the 2636 from Signetics as well. About 40 cartridges has been released for the Interton VC-4000, but we can't tell how many were available for the OC-2000, nor if exclusive games were developped for it...\nLike with all the systems of this \"Interton family\", there are two controllers with 12 buttons keypad + a joystick. Controllers were designed to use informative plastic layers delivered with each games, showing the functions of each key. The control panel is composed of an ON\/OFF switch and 5 buttons. But the most original feature is the cartridge storage compartment located in the middle of the case. Here you can store up to 7 cartridges, waiting to be played. The whole compartment is covered by a removable transparent plastic part. The cosmetic aspect of the console is thus excellent !\nThere were several models only different by their case colour. Strangely some white models were not marketed as OC-2000 but under the \"Jeu video TV - Karvan\" name.\nThe most interesting feature of the OC-2000 is surely the cartridge N?13 called \"Hobby Computer\". It turned the console into a real Signetics 2650-based computer, with 2 KB RAM and 2 KB ROM. You had to program it in assembler via the two controller keypads and the console function buttons. There was even a tape-interface so you could save your creations onto tapes. This was maybe never commercialy released but was at least produced and sent to some journalists (Thanks to Fran?ois Houste for the info).\nOne particularity about this videogame \"family\" (VC-4000 &amp; clones), is that they seem to be the only systems which required the game to be loaded into internal RAM from the cartridge, before being able to play (generally through a LOAD PROGRAM or equivalent button found on the control panel).",

        "description": "The Xerox 6085 was the successor of the revolutionary Xerox <b>Star<\/b>, first commercial computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI) with the familiar desktop, icons and a mouse. \nThe 6085 series was offered in models for network, remote (linked by Ethernet) and stand alone operation. The main unit was founded upon Xerox's Mesa 8 MHz processor which had 256 auxiliary registers and executed 48-bit-wide instructions. It also used an 80186 as an auxiliary processor. \nThe basic system came with 1.1 MB of memory, expandable up to 3.7 MB, a 10 to 80 MB hard disk drive, two serial ports and a 15-inch high-resolution monochrome display. An optional card allowed the 6085 to run MS-DOS software.\nThe operating system and GUI interface was called <b>ViewPoint<\/b>. It also came from the Star. It was written in a language developed at  Xerox PARC in the 1970's and also called <b>Mesa<\/b>. This strongly-typed and structured high-level language, would have a large influence on future well known languages like Pascal or C. \nTwo improved versions were launched afterwards, the <b>6085-II<\/b> with an almost twice as fast processor, and the <b>XPIW<\/b> (Xerox Publishing Illustrator's Workstation), basically a 6085 workstation with a scanner.\nSadly, like the Alto, the 6085 didn't meet a large success in spite of numerous vanguard concepts, mainly because the Xerox marketing policy was, at the time, above all directed towards copiers rather than computers.",

        "description": "Peter Crunden-White, the proud owner of this Microcomputer Trainer, sent us some photos along with the following note:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nIn about 1986, I purchased a Science Fair Microcomputer Trainer (MCT) from my local branch of Tandy (in Cheshire, UK). The machine was sold by Tandy shops, it was one of their 'wire-it-yourself' project kits and ran on 6 penlight batteries.\n \nI recall that my older brother wired it up for me, but we never really had much success with it, although we enjoyed playing the built-in games (including tennis and rat-bashing) and programming tunes in.  Ironically, it wasn't until years later that I actually had any success programming it.\nIt had a set of about 30 commands (15 simple, plus some 'extended'), which were entered through the keyboard.  The keyboard suffered badly from switch bounce; increment would sometimes be registered twice, causing much annoyance.\n \nThe CPU (or rather MCU ? Micro Computer Unit) was a Texas Instruments TMS1100.  This was an expanded version of their flagship \"computer-on-a-chip\"; the TMS1000, which was used in their \"Speak and Spell\" toy.  According to the MCT manual, the clock speed was 400kHz ? but this is higher than the specification for the chip!  (Were Science Fair guilty of over-clocking!?!).  Presumably the monitor was burnt into ROM ? the 30 commands the end user uses being interpreted.\nThere was no bulk storage: programs were lost when power was removed, so had to written down manually.  (I did consider driving the keyboard from my Sinclair Spectrum so I could save\/edit programs before 'downloading' them to the MCT, but never got around to it).\nThe most fun I had with it was when I wired three address LEDs to control a toy drum machine.  I then wrote a program that would play an eight-note tune (wow!) in time with a beat from the drum machine.\nThe manual contains instructions for the built-in games and example programs (complete with flowcharts).  Some of the example programs are quite complicated (given how tedious entering them would have been).  A ?Slot Machine? game comes with a disclaimer: <i>This ?slot machine? behaves very much like those that you see at amusement arcades.  But you can only play it for fun ? the Microcomputer Trainer has not been programmed to give cash prizes.<\/i> ? no kidding!\n<\/font>\n<b>Javier Perez<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I think they overclocked the TMS1100. I checked the internet and it's top speed was 300khz it was an expanded version of the TMS 1000. Made in early 1975 it's memory was ROM 2KB RAM 64 bits. It was a PMOS or MCU . it took 43 standard instructions and 1024 micro instructions.So truly i think they overclocked it by mistake or to sell it but anyone i've only had a chance to see one open but not play with it.tooo bad looked intresting.<\/font>",

        "description": "The GridCase was about the same size and featured the same robust magnesium case as <a href=\"computer.asp?c=900\">Compass<\/a> model, but Grid forwent the Compass's expensive and power-hungry electroluminescent display and bubble memory.\nThe GridCase series was composed of 4 models. The <b>GridCase I<\/b> featured a bottom-of-the-range LCD display, the <b>GridCase II<\/b> had an enhanced LCD \"<i>that more than one person can read<\/i>\" Grid said, the <b>GridCase III<\/b> offered a high-contrast gas-plasma display (photo), and the <b>GridCase IV<\/b> which used a full size yellow electoluminescent screen that was also offered on the high end earlier Grid Compass Computers.\nThe keyboard was the same as the IBM PCjr, not very convenient but with a good tactile feedback provided by a key click similar to that on the IBM PC. Two power modules were available, a rechargeable battery pack and an AC transformer. Both were the same size and fitted in a large socket on the rear panel. Each battery pack lasted 4 to 5 hours for the LCD models, and one hour with the plasma model.\nAll models came with eight sockets for ROM chips. Although only four of them could be accessed by the user, Grid offered programs such as MS-DOS, GW-BASIC or Lotus 1-2-3 on ROM chips.\nSeveral peripherals were available, a base station battery charger and power source, a 5.25\" and 3.5\" floppy disk drive units and a 10 MB hard disk. They all were of the same size and could be stacked.\nSome of these systems were made for military use and included a built-in hard drive. A big thick X was pressed into the case over the hard drive. The purpose of this was to show the user where to shoot in case the computer was in danger of falling into enemy hands.\nGRiD Defence Systems produced the laptop computers used in the \"Aliens\" film in 1986. The scenes were cut from the theatrical release but subsequently added to the DVD release.\nThe GridCase systems were marketed in France by Sagem. There were a least the MTP16, MTP32 and MTP1550 models available. The MTP32 had a plasma display and a built-in hard disk and was powered 386 CPU. It could be the equivalent of the GridCase III. The MTP1550 had a LCD display and a kind of bar at the bottom of the keyboard which acted like a mouse\/trackball... These systems were indeed quite sturdy and most of them were used for military applications.\n_______________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> David Griffith, Guy, J?r?me Ginestet<b><\/b><\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1054\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

Both systems seem identical despite a different cosmetic design : same chipset, same games, same controls, switches and buttons, etc...\nThe console is plastic with nice woodgrain accents. A knob allows you to select from the four games. There are two buttons, one for reset and one to serve the \"ball\", and five switches: power, serve (manual\/auto), speed (fast\/normal), angle (wide\/narrow) and bat size (small\/large). There are two wired paddle controllers which can be mounted to each side of the cabinet, or removed. These remote controls are only equiped with a small dial. The games selection is made through a knob... This game runs on either six C-cell batteries, or a 9-volt adapter with a 1\/8\" jack.\nCOMMERCIAL TEXTS (same as Paddle IV):\n- Featuring 4 games with detachable remotre control\n- Automatic on screen scoring\n- Simply attached to your black &amp; white or color TV set",

It was sold by Philips and was only available in France. The same system was sold in the rest of Europe as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1080\">Videopac G7000<\/a>, both systems being in fact identical apart from the frenchised keyboard...\nIn fact several C52 models were marketed with minor differences between each others. These systems were labeled C52\/01, C52\/02, C52\/03 or C52\/04. 01 and 02 models had a nice power on\/off button, detachable controllers, and external power supply with its own connector at the back of the system (system pictured here is a C52\/02 model). For cost reduction sake, latest models (04) had no power switch (you plug the system to turn it on!), hard wired controllers and built-in power supply. There were also different packagings, and controllers were sometimes black, sometimes silver...\nThe system is powered by an Intel 8048 microcontroller and a Video Display Controller (VDC) generating all audio &amp; video. This VDC, which is a custom Intel IC, can generate 4 different types of graphic objects: a background grid, single characters, quad characters (made of 4 single characters) and sprites. A maximum of 4 independent sprites can be displayed. There are monochrome and of 8 x 8 pixels in size. Of course the VDC can detect sprite collisions.\nThe C52 has 64 pre-defined characters (letters and graphic symbols) in memory. Up to 12 foreground characters can be displayed from this internal character set. Many games (especially early ones) used a lot those pre-defined characters: man walking, right arrow, slopes, tree, ships, plane and a ball.\nThe flat membrane keyboard of the C52 was a major selling point. It was meant to be used for game selection, educational games, programming, entering its name for hi-scores,etc. Apart from the game selection, it was hardly used.\nThough not as popular as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari VCS<\/a>, or later <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellivision<\/a> in the USA, the Videopac systems did very well in Europe where it was marketed by several different brands (Philips, Radiola, Schneider, Brandt, Siera, etc.). An enhanced system with high resolution background graphics was released a bit later as the <b>Philips G7400<\/b>.",

The most remarquable feature was its neat gas plasma display wich lifted up and swiveled so that it could be placed in a good position for reading. \nThe machine shipped with either a 20 MB or 40 MB hard-disk. Two internal cards could be added, a RAM card (up to 2 MB) and a 1200-baud modem card. An external expansion box allowed to add two standard IBM-AT cards and carry them along with the computer.",

Its Intel 386-20 processor offered more speed, power and capabilities than ever before.\nAbout the Portable 386, PC Magazine said in its review:\n<i>\nIts the hottest thing you can pick up with a handle. At 20 MHz, it outperforms everything else on the market but its deskbound sibling . Yet it's rugged enough for on-the-go computing, takes standard PC cards in an elegantly engineered span-on expansion chassis, and weighs less than 20 pounds. Some folks may not like the styling, but everyone loves the way it performs. <\/i>\nThe portable 386 and Portable III had great success around the world, as well as the desktop versions,  Compaq Deskpro 286-12 and 386\/20. At about the same time as the 386 launch, Compaq announced having manufactured its 1- millionth personal computer. \nLater, this robust machine was upgraded by third companies up to 486\/80 CPU, 10 MB RAM and 9 GB hard-disk.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1065\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

All of the applications placed in this slot - including Multiplan and the optional BASIC interpreter - could be copied onto disk then loaded in RAM\nThe Japanese-made Tandy 600 was a light and well designed machine. However, it quickly suffered from the competition of portable PC compatible systems and didn't sell well.",

It was also used to help students, technicians and engineers understand how to repair faulty microprocessor-based systems.\nMounted in a brief case, the HP 5036A provided both the hardware and software basics and vital troubleshooting information needed to solve hardware problems. The board held a 8085A CPU, 2 KB ROM and 1 KB RAM. Displays for the Address\/Register\/Data were 6 digit, 7-segment LED displays. Output port had 8 LED's, one for each line. Address bus had 16 LED's, one per line. Status lines had 6 LED's; one per line. I\/O's 8-bit latched output port with LED indicators, and 8-bit input port with DIP switch. Several DIP switch were used to disconnect MPU data lines from data bus, select test loop program or run a program in test mode. Twelve user-programmable fault jumpers on circuit board simulated various hardware faults.\nThe HP 5036A shipped with a very complete 450+ page course book, which covered both hardware and software in detail in separate chapters containing summaries, hands-on experiments and quizzes. Once these chapters were completed, the course built up to a series of troubleshooting experiments employing recommended troubleshooting instruments (HP 5024A Logic Troubleshooting Kit, HP 5006A Signature Analyzer...) that challenge the user and reinforce microprocessor operating concepts. The book also contained information on the use of oscilloscopes, signature analyzers, logic analyzers, and logic probes for troubleshooting microprocessor-based products.",

On the rear panel, one also found one HP-IB port and 8 expansion slots.\nLike the 9825, it ran HPL, but could also run BASIC and Pascal. The Basic interpreter was developped by HP and was also known as \"Rocky Mountain BASIC\", or RMB. This version would evolve into the HP-BASIC for the series-300 and HP-UX machines.\nThe 9826 was choosen and intensively used by the Walt Disney studios for \"Tron\", the first movie that used a computer to control all the processes implemented during the shoot, from camera adjustments to graphic and text superimpositions.",

The whole family of Micropro software - WordStar, CalcStar, DataStar, ReportStar... was specially modified to fit MBC-1000 features. Sbasic, an extended Basic interpreter, was included into the CP\/M master diskette. \nSanyo CP\/M machines had a discreet life in business world and were gradually replaced by PC compatible systems.\nExtracts from the marketing brochure:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n- Compact design integrating all the functions for multi-purpose applications\n- Z-80A CPU ensures high-speed processing with no-wait mode\n- A substantial library of business software has been developed in the United States to Sanyo's specifications. Sanyo will also offer word-processing, electronic spread-sheets, and related software to its distributor and dealer network. A user encyclopedia for the extensive, powerful SBASIC II is supplied with the machine. The Sanyo computer will support all CP\/M compatible software and along with the appropriate interpreter or compiler, programs can be run in C-Basic, M-Basic, Fortran, Cobol, Forth and others. Sanyo will support and publish a list of approved software products to its dealers, distributors and end users.\n- SBASIC II adds several additional commands and statements to those featured by Microsoft BASIC. The disket supplied includes a set of Check programs and Utilities allowing extra programming flexibility.\n- Built-in floppy disk drive with file copy procedure can be expanded to incorporate up to three 5\"1\/4 or two 8\" additional floppy disk drives. The expandability to over 2.3 MB of disk storage assures the capacity to meet your needs.\n- Easy-to-operate typewriter-style keyboard with numeric pad and five function keys for easy program execution\n- 12\" non-glare green phosphor video display screen showing up to 256 standard and graphic characters. For special graphic or alpha-numeric needs, programmable character generator allows you to change any character to meet these requirements.\n- Centronics parallel printer port, RS-232C serial port, and additional 5\"1\/4 floppy expansion disk port are standard.\n- Additional interface cards are available for a parallel port or RS-232 port.\n- The interface card for the EFD860F (additional 8\" external drives) is packaged with the EFD860F\n<\/font>",

It was sold by Philips and was only available in Europe. Other brands (related to Philips) sold the same system in Europe too : Radiola JET 25, Schneider G7000, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1081\">Siera G7000<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1060\">Philips C52<\/a> (only available in France).\nThe system is powered by an Intel 8048 microcontroller and a Video Display Controller (VDC) generating all audio &amp; video. This VDC, which is a custom Intel IC, can generate 4 different types of graphic objects: a background grid, single characters, quad characters (made of 4 single characters) and sprites. A maximum of 4 independent sprites can be displayed. There are monochrome and of 8 x 8 pixels in size. Of course the VDC can detect sprite collisions.\nThe G7000 has 64 pre-defined characters (letters and graphic symbols) in memory. Up to 12 foreground characters can be displayed from this internal character set. Many games (especially early ones) used a lot those pre-defined characters: man walking, right arrow, slopes, tree, ships, plane and a ball.\nThe flat membrane keyboard of the G7000 was a major selling point. It was meant to be used for game selection, educational games, programming, entering its name for hi-scores,etc. Apart from the game selection, it was hardly used.\nThe Philips G7000 also provided assembly programming via the purchase of a program card although the actual input of your own code was rather long-winded and often ended in a complete reset being required...\nThough not as popular as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari VCS<\/a>, or later <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellivision<\/a> in the USA, the Videopac systems did very well in Europe where it was marketed by several different brands (Philips, Radiola, Schneider, Brandt, Siera, etc.).

Their developments paralleled, but were to a considerable extent independent of computer developments in Europe and the USA. \nThe CSIR Mk1 ran its first test programs in late 1949  and it was the fifth electronic stored program computer ever developed. It embodied many features novel at the time and was able to operate more than 1000 times faster than the best mechanical calculators. The machine was officially opened in 1951 and used to solve problems both for the Radiophysics Laboratory and outside organisations. It was decommissioned in 1955 and shipped to Melbourne. \nOn 14 June 1956 the Mk1 was recommissioned and renamed CSIRAC and the new Computation Laboratory at the University of Melbourne was officially opened. It was in Melbourne that CSIRAC came into its own as a general computing workhorse - from June 1956 to June 1964 over 700 computing projects were processed. \nIn November 1964, Dr. Frank Hirst switched CSIRAC off for the last time and donated it to the Museum of Victoria. It is now at the Melbourne Museum, and was modified to blink its lights on and off for the exhibition, although it isn't actually turned on.\nInformation taken from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cs.mu.oz.au\/csirac\/\" target=\"_blank\">detailed page<\/a> of the University of Melbourne dedicated to the CSIRAC computer.",

The G7200 was to be used when the \"one family TV\" was occupied by the parents. The G7200 could then be (not easily for a children) moved to a bedroom for endless fun (as they said). And when the main TV was free, it was possible to connect the G7200 to it, and to enjoy crisp  &amp; colorful display through its SCART video cable!\nThe two controller connectors are placed discreetly on the front side, under the keyboard. There are three different knobs to adjust diffetent settings : display contrast, display brightness and volume control. Quite handy.\nAppart from that it is nothing more than a classic Videopac system with a built-in display, compact keyboard and a few added options...\nSchneider and Radiola also marketed this model under thier own brand : <b>Schneider 7200<\/b> and <b>Radiola JET 27<\/b>, both using a blue case.

Still no transistors or printed circuit boards, it contained hundreds of thermionic valves in lines of six foot tall racks of circuitry.\nThere were two kinds of storage. The high speed store consisted of mercury delay lines and held 402 words in all. There were 12 long delay lines holding 32 words each and some short lines, known as temporary stores, which held one, two and four words. The time taken for the contents of one delay line to circulate was called a 'major cycle', the time of one word was a 'minor cycle'. There were 32 minor cycles in one major cycle. The words were all of the same length, 32 binary digits (about 10 decimal digits).\nWords were stored in the delay lines as a succession of pulses of 1? sec duration. A minor cycle was therefore 32 ?sec and a major cycle was 1O24 ?sec, or just over 1 m.sec. All operations were performed in the high speed store.\nThe secondary storage was a magnetic drum which holds 8192 words, disposed in 256 tracks of 32 words each. The drum itself was a rapidly rotating cylinder coated with magnetic material. There were 'reading heads' and 'writing heads', to transfer information to and from the high speed store. A whole track was transferred with one instruction. Access to the drum was much slower than to the high speed store.\nInput and output were by means of conventional punched card equipment. Cards might be read at a rate of 200 per minute and punched at 100 cards per minute. 64 columns of a card were used by DEUCE, which means that 24 words punched in binary can be read from one card.\nThe console, at the front of the machine, had a bewildering array of keys and lights and two cathode ray monitor tubes. These tubes displayed the contents of the temporary stores and any selected long delay line.\nBetween 1953 and 1964, 33 machines were sold worldwide to various research and development establishments.\n<font color=\"#0040FF\">All this information is courtesy of the <a href=\"http:\/\/users.tpg.com.au\/eedeuce\/intro.htm\" target=\"_blank\">DEUCE web \nsite<\/a> which provides lots of original information, photos and testimonies about the DEUCE computer.<\/font>",

It was in fact manufactured in the USA.\nThe ACT-800 was built as an attempt to design a computer that would last 7 years without becoming obsolete. Why therefore the specifications were so dated from the start is mystery. The machine was clearly based on the Commodore PET line of computer which were very, very popular certainly in the UK - far more than the US registers.  \nThe ACT-800 was an 'all in one unit' but with an external 5.25'' disk drive.  The CPU was a 6502 running at 2 MHz (to give it the 'edge' over the PET.)  The machine had text only modes so no graphics to speak of but did handle 80 columns on screen.  RAM was 48 KB and ROM included a rendering of BASIC similar to the PET's.\nThat was it.  It was no a revolutionary machine by any stretch of the imagination and the computer was far from a commercial success.  \n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Laurence Coombes<\/b> for the info.<\/font>\nAbout the ACT-800, <b>Steve Squires<\/b> sent us this information:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nBack in 1982 there was a very obscure machine kicking around which was badged the \"ACT 800\". It was a on-piece unit with a single circuit board, housed inside a huge case. The keyboard was built-in and permanently affixed to the top was a monochrome monitor (about 14 inches).\n \nTo service it you simply unscrewed a couple of screws at the bottom and the entire top half (monitor and keyboard) hinged up from the back (a bit like the Commodore PET) and was propped up on a metal arm a bit like an engine hood.\n \nThis monster actually had plug-in options for an external dual 8-inch floppy unit and had a built-in IEE488 port.

        "description": "With the PC-1251, Sharp started off their product range of really tiny pocket \ncomputers. It was the third original design after the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=936\">PC-121x<\/a> and \n<a href=\"computer.asp?c=965\">PC-1500<\/a> series.\nContrary to its predecessors, it was really pocket sized, measuring only 135 x 70 x 9.5 mm. Nevertheless, it featured a 24 character display, and with 4 KB RAM it even outclassed the PC-1500 basic version. The major drawback of the new design was that the tiny keys are only compatible with pointed fingers.\nThe PC-1251 was based on a new 8-bit CMOS micro processor, the SC61860, which \nwas mounted on the main PCB together with the display driver chip SC43536. On an additional small PCB, 24 KB ROM (LH532917) and 4 KB RAM (two HM6116 2k x 8 \nchips) were located. A new feature was the so-called \"reserve memory\" which \nallowed to assign often used BASIC commands or functions to 18 of the \nalphanumeric keys.\nTogether with the PC-1251, the CE-125 thermal printer and micro cassette \nrecorder unit was introduced. With integrated NiCd accumulators, it was fully \nmains independent and made the 1251 into a very compact mobile computing system. The CE-125 also featured an additional tape interface for external tape recorders.\nThe PC-1250 was the same machine as the PC-1251 but with only 2 KB of RAM.\nThanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\">site<\/a> for information and picture.",

This way, the TV-Action is only compliant with a short range of TV, all designed and created by Blaupunkt : Jamaica, Riviera, Nevada and Columbia series. Some other companies, such as Grundig, had the same politic and created some system that were only compliant with their own brand?s TV sets.\nIt?s important to notice that, on this system, no external power supply is required, as it comes directly from the TV set on which the video game system is connected to... using the same cord as for game display (video).\nExcept for this connectivity weirdness, the TV-Action is nothing but a classic Pong system, providing 4 different games (Tennis, Pelota, Hockey and Squash), with the classical speed\/size\/angle options. It?s composed of two controllers : the main one is directly connected to the TV set and contains all the games options &amp; hardware (GI chip), while the second controller, connected to the first one, is smaller and offer a slider used by the second player to move his paddle. \n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text, info &amp; pictures by <b>Fran?ois Houste<\/b>.<\/font>",

They were neither clones nor licencied, but original Hungarian home computers.\nThe <b>HomeLab-2<\/b> (see the 'More pictures' section) was also called <b>Aircomp-16<\/b>. It was made by a little agro-electronics company called the <i>Personal Agroelektronikai GT<\/i>.\nThanks to <b>K?pes G?bor<\/b> for all this information and pictures.\nAll of the HomeLab versions could also be homebrew built or assembled by the HCC (Hungarian Computer Club), an association of amateur computer fans.\nThe <b>Brailab<\/b> (pictured) was an exciting curiosity. It was a speaking Homelab-4 version especially intended for blind people. It featured a nice retro robot voice and a perfect Hungarian phonetics reproduction. It was a member of the BraiLab series. The text-to-speech system was conceived by Andr?s Arat? and Ter?z Vasp?ri.\nIt was made by the <i>Color Ipari Szovetkezet<\/i> factory, in Domb?v?r, a little Hungarian city. Only 400 machines were made between 1985 and 1987.\nThe BraiLab ran with a simple tape recorder and could be connected to either a TV set (VHF) or a monochrome monitor. A blind user could use it only with a tape recorder, hear but not watch the data.\nThe BraiLab was followed by the <b>BraiLab Plus<\/b> with floppy and CP\/M system then by the <b>BraiLab PC<\/b>, a text-to-speech interface for IBM PCs.\nClick <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/Museum\/downloads\/Homelab\/voice.mp3\">here<\/a> to hear a BraiLab voice synthesizer sample.

It was sold by General Home Products (GHP) in 1976, and is basically a <a href=\"computer.asp?st=3&amp;c=1281\">Magnavox Odyssey 300<\/a>. As a matter of fact, Wonder Wizard systems were manufactued by Magnavox. Model 7702 contains the same circuit board than <a href=\"computer.asp?st=3&amp;c=1281\">Odyssey 300<\/a>, and the bottom part of its plastic case is identical to the one used for the first Odyssey system.\nAs this system is same as <a href=\"computer.asp?st=3&amp;c=1281\">Magnavox Odyssey 300<\/a> (except for the case), the game difficulty levels are set the same way using a 3-position switch to choose one of three combinations of difficulties (ball speed, ball angle and bat size). Thus, all difficulty levels cannot be used. The switch allows using three predefined difficulty levels, whereas most other PONG games had separate switches to change the speed, ball and paddle size and rebound angles.\nFinally, this system exist in several forms. One has black knobs and woodgrain all over the top side of the case (as pictured), another has silver discs on both knobs, and woodgrain only on the title area (rectangle over switches), and a different version is a mix with silver discs and all woodgrain case...\n_________________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Source : <\/b><a href=\"htpp:\/\/www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pong-story.com<\/a>\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "In 1991 Sega entered the handheld marked with its Game Gear console to\ncompete with Nintendo's popular Game Boy. The hardware was pretty much a\ndirect copy of Sega's 8-bit <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=840\">Master System<\/a> technology which was just\ndramatically reduced in size to fit the handheld case. There was also an\nadapter called Master Gear which enabled you to play SMS games on your GG.\nThe only real difference between the Master System and the Game Gear is that\nthe GG has a color palette of 4096 compared to the 256 of the SMS. This is\npretty much the only reason why the SMS can't play GG games.\nCompared to Nintendo's Game Boy, Game Gear has many advanced features like a\nquite big backlit color screen (3.2''), which even the original Game Boy Advance\ndoesn't have, and a more ergonomical case design.\nBut this was not enough to win the handheld battle. Nintendo's console\nalready had many good games available whereas GG had mostly conversions of\nold SMS games with added colors. It was also more expensive that the Game\nBoy due to its color screen. The battery life of the GG was also quite short\nwith the batteries of the time (not so much of problem nowadays as batteries\nhave improved) and it also took six AA sized batteries at once which was\nquite a strain on the owners wallet. The machine was also more fragile that\nthe Game Boy and many of the machines that you can see for sale today have\nscratches on their screen and sound problems especially when using\nheadphones.\n___________________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text by Taneli Lukka<\/font>",

        "description": "In 1977, a new type of ball and paddle system was launched: Video Pinball. This game also existed in the arcade under the same name, hence the home versions sold by Atari (Video Pinball, model C-380) and Sears (<a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1114\">Pinball Breakaway, model 99713<\/a>). There even was a japanese version, the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=800\">Epoch TV Block<\/a>.\nThese systems were designed around a more advanced chip than the PONG-in-a-chip devices, possibly a microcontroller (believed, since the system also contains a small RAM chip which role is unknown, but believed to be for the display and\/or score storage). The microcontroller is referred as C011500-1, although the system uses another Atari chip referenced C011512-05.\nThe games played are based around the pinball and breakout principles. Bumper controllers on the sides or a dial on the front were used to control the games. Depending on the game selected, the ball bounces on two bumpers (pinball games), or on a pad that moves horizontally (pinpaddle games), or just like in breakout. Obviously, each game had its own principles. In reality, the system played three different games.\nThe first one had four variants and was a pinball game. Some graphics and the type of bounce changed. Depending on the variant, you controled the ball with your flippers (via side buttons) or by moving a paddle with the knob. In the flipper versions, the ball had nice parabolic movement affected by the gravity whereas in the paddle versions, there was no gravity.\nThe second game was a basketball game. The ball bounced on a pad moved horizontally, and the goal was to let the ball go in a multicolor basket.\nThe third type of game was <a href=\"software_detail.asp?id=363\">breakout<\/a>. There was another variant called <a href=\"software_detail.asp?id=364\">Breakway\/Breakthru<\/a>, the only difference between the two versions being a hole in the wall in place of the green bricks. Top red bricks could only be destroyed if the ball was coming directly from the paddle. This second version was only found on early models (read below).\nLike said above, Atari and Sears marketed their own version (both designed by Atari), and Atari even released a latter cheaper model with a slightly different beige case.\nThe second basketball game (Basketball II\/ Rebound II) was only found on the latter version of the Atari Video Pinball (beige model) and on the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=800\">Epoch TV-Block<\/a>. Early versions of the Atari Video Pinball and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1114\">Sears Pinball Breakaway<\/a> had the second version of the Breakout game instead, called Breakway or Breakthru.\n____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">SOURCE : <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pong-story.com<\/a>\n\t\n<\/font>",

        "description": "The MUPID (Multipurpose Universal Programmable Intelligent Decoder) was originally mainly marketed as a Prestel (or BTX as it was called in Austria and Germany) terminal for the Austrian post office (that operated this service).\nHowever, contrary to numerous dumb videotext terminals used in various European countries, this one was actually a true home computer featuring a Z80 microprocessor, BASIC, a large amount of memory (128kB), a colour video interface and several I\/O ports. It could be connected to any colour TV set and provided 1200\/75 baud modem, tape recorder and parallel printer interfaces. An external floppy drive unit was also available.\nA very modern specialty was the ability of this computer to execute programs stored on the Prestel server (which was possible because the machine was designed directly for using the national Prestel system). The developers were obviously that amazed by this ability that they even based the Basic development system on this feature - you first had to load e.g. the editor from the server).\nThe Mupid was developed between 1980 and 1983 by a team at the Institute for Information Processing Graz (\"Institute f?r Informationsverarbeitung Graz (IIG)\") at the Technical University Graz led by Prof. Hermann Maurer (whose team later on developed the ill-fated WWW competitor HyperWave) and Prof. Posch.\nFor the industrial exploitation an own company, 1983 the Mupid Computer Corporation (\"Mupid Computer Gesellschaft (MCG)\") was founded whose stockholders were big Austrian companies like VOEST and Siemens. 6% of the sales went to the IIG for which it was a very good source of funding. 1987 the MCG dissolved. 1989 the last Mupid was built.\nThe machine itself had for the time very good color and graphics capabilities.\nThis was caused by the requirements of the Austrian (and CEPT) Prestel standards (The Austrian Prestel capabilities were by far better than other European systems.\nYou could transmit 4096-colour images instead of 16 elsewhere). <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1119\">The Mupid 2<\/a> models even provided support for the most advanced of the standard options: Cept C2. C2 is a vector graphics tool kit that was close to the Grahical Kernel (GKS) standard with a resolution of 320x240 pixels and with functions like splines(!).\nBeing a home computer, Mupid had some Basic capabilities built in the ROM - but not a complete development system as other computers. The Basic (or Basics as there were several versions) compiled into an intermediate code - and the Mupid only got an interpreter for this intermediate code. The development system (editor, compiler, other tools) that were needed to create this code consists of programs that needed to be loaded from a Prestel server. The Basic was very powerful and you could also access the Prestel system.\nAlso the optional serially-attached floppy system fit into this system. It could either be used in the traditional way as an intelligent storage system for which a CP\/M was available.\nIt could also be used as a local Prestel server thus replacing the remote connection to the Prestel system. Using this way, you could use e.g. the Basic development environment locally. Two different floppy systems were available. An intelligent 5.25' system (64KB RAM, 8 KB ROM, Z80 CPU) or a dumb 3.5' system that was controlled by the Mupid. Therefore, some documentation warn you that the display might flicker if you execute CP\/M commands on the latter system...\nIf you want to use a Mupid system nowadays, you do not have to time travel to the past in order to connect to the today's defunct Prestel system. You even do not have to buy a floppy disc system for the Mupid system (and they are even more rare than the machines itself). Instead, you can use a PC program that connects your PC to a Mupid serially and that emulates a floppy system (that in turn can emulate a Prestel server).\nThe Mupid was followed by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1119\">Mupid 2<\/a> which had a better keyboard, and which supported the CEPT Prestel standard instead of the national Austrian one. At their time, the Austrian post office even replaces Mupid 1 by Mupid 2s for free (I wonder what they did with all these returned Mupid 1 models).\nThere were 3 Mupid 2 models:\n - C2D  (German version of the square tin case with separate keyboard)\n  According to some rumor, these models did not went into sales.\n - C2D2 (German version of the compact case labelled \"Komfort MUPID\")\n - C2A2 (Austrian version of the compact case)\n- In addition there was a Mupid card for early PCs.\nApart from the floppy disc drive, there was one additional option for the Mupid 2.\nThe so-called \"Permanent Memory\" upgraded a normal Mupid 2 to a \"Komfort Mupid\"\n(it seems that all German C2D2 models were Komfort Mupids). This option consists of a battery-buffered 128 KB CMOS memory that costed an enormous 420 Euro (currently about 650$). This memory allowed either:\n - to store and reload existing Prestel pages without additional costs\n - to store BASIC programs or graphics without other external memory\n - to be used as a RAM disc (this even allowed to run CP\/M without a floppy disc)\nThere were even OEM models of the Mupids. The Grundig PTC 100 was a Mupid C2D2 in a different color (the floppy disc station was the Grundig FL100), the Siemens T3110 a C2D.\nNumberwise the Mupids are rather rare computers. The published sale numbers vary, but it sounds reasonable that about 8000 Mupid 1s are reported to be sold (in their selling period between 1984 and August 1985), and 40000 Mupids (i.e. model 1 and 2) in total.\nIf you want to test your Mupid, you try the following key-combinations:\n(With (K) I mean the blue K-Key, and ctrl-2 means: hold the ctrl-key and hit \"2\")\n(K) L .............. changing to the local-mode. Now key-hits are displayed on the screen.\nctrl-2 \/ B ......... clear screen (only in local-mode)\nctrl-1 # blanc T ... screen is blue\nctrl-shift-c ....... foreground (character) yellow \"Text\"\n\n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors :<\/b> Fritz Hohl.<\/font>",

Well first, the name... ;-) The underside and switches of the former are orange while those of the Colour TV Game are grey. The Colour TV Game has also a small 'colour' logo next to its name (upper right), which the TV Master lacks.\nThe paddles are rather small, with one knob each, but are detachable and connected to the system through two small sockets. One interesting feature is that there is a switch to turn sound on \/ off (great !).",

        "description": "What a weird system we have here! This must be one of the rarest and most original consoles ever produced. It only plays one game: Star Chess, a version of chess which takes place in space, for two players. \nThe system itself looks like a box with a transparent plastic cover, revealing four silver controllers stored into the plastic case. Actually, only two of the silver oblongs are real controllers, attached by extendable wires to the console for 2 players. Another silver oblong opens out into the instruction manual, and the last one cannot be moved and contains sound on\/off + power on\/off switches and reset button. \nStar Chess is based on the well known game of chess but your chessmen are space ships engaged in Galactic Warfare. The game board is laid out as a normal chessboard with space ships instead of chess pieces. Two players take turns moving their ships (no solo play). The rules and moves are based on chess but with some additions. You can fire missiles at your opponents, you have shields, you can get a damage report, you can return to base to stock up on missiles used up, and if you are in trouble you can warp into hyperspace. But beware, you can re-appear at anytime in a random position on the board and be in a worse situation! To win the game you have to destroy or capture your opponent's \"commander\" (king).\nAn interesting fact is that this game can also be found on <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Emerson Arcadia 2001<\/a> and compatible systems! So, some questions come to mind: is it the exact same game put in a standalone console (see the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/museum\/software.asp?c=1116&amp;st=2\">software page<\/a>, we can see here that the two versions are not exactly the same)? Which version came first? What are the origins of this game? If you can answer these questions, please mail us!\nAt various stages the company was called Voltmace or Videomaster (owned by Waddingtons, a huge boardgame company). They released a console called Voltmace Database in 1978 (?) which was <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> \"compatible\", but never released an \"Arcadia 2001 compatible system\" able to play the famous Star Chess game. Maybe Videomaster did not want repeat the Voltmace Database experience, and decided, upon pressure from Waddingtons, to release only a standalone system playing a board game, Star Chess, using technology and software they had access to. Just a guess though... \nAnyway, the system did not sell very well and is now an interesting collectors item.\nImportant, read the real story from the inventor himself, Peter Gebler, in the first comment below!\n_______________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Special thanks to Michael Davidson for his knowledge, which helped me write this.\n\t\n<\/font>",

Technically they are the same as the Vtech machines and the machine still says Vtech Laser 200 when booted.\nThe machine sold reasonably well because of Salora's good reputation, but was soon crushed by bigger companies like Commodore and Spectravideo with their better machines. Lack of software was an important factor of course. The machine was also a bit out of date on arrival.\nThe machine wasn't really localized as the Scandinavian ?,? and ? letter were missing from the keyboard. Adding them to the rubber keys must have been too difficult or expensive.\nThere were two known mainboard revisions:\n? The one shown on the more-pictures section is identical with the original Laser 200 and very badly made with lots of wires, hot glue and a small sister board.\n? The second one is of much better quality, as good as big company machines like Commodore, no sister board and only one long wire running through the whole board. There is also a switch on the underside of the machine to choose between color\/black&amp;white output. Maybe Salora got tired of fixing broken Fellow's and demanded better quality from Vtech?\nSalora also distributed the Laser 2001 as the <b>Manager<\/b>. It was meant to be the high-end computer of Salora's computer range.\nThanks to <b>Taneli Lukka<\/b> from Finland for this information.",

        "description": "The Salora Manager was the Finnish version of the Video Technology <a href=\"computer.asp?c=43\">Laser 2001<\/a>.\nHowever, it had some differences compared to the original:\n? It had a new case to match the cheaper <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1117\">Fellow<\/a> in the more Salora-like colouring,\n? The keyboard had been modified by adding the Scandinavian letters ?, ? and ?,\n? Joysticks ports were different so you could only use joysticks manufactured by Salora (many machines were hacked to use Atari-standard controllers).\nThe Coleco adapter was planned for the Manager too, but was propably never released. Some pre-production examples did make it out the door.\nA 5 1\/4\" disk drive was also released in the Salora color scheme.\nThe Salora machines had some brief success because Salora was a well known company in Finland and people didn't really know how global the computer market was. In the end Salora machines disappeared quite quickly mainly due to lack of software and the onslaught of Commodore and Spectravideo.\nDuring the last days of the machine they were sold at rock bottom prices. You could get a Manager + disk drive + games\/programs bundle for less than the price of a Commodore disk drive!\nAfter the Vtech fiasco Salora had plans or they actually  even announced it, that they were to start distributing Mitsubishi manufactured MSX machines and peripherals under the Salora brand, but this never happened. This information regarding the MSX ordeal can be found from the Finnish MikroBitti magazine.\nThanks to <b>Taneli Lukka<\/b> for this information.\nThanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelikonepeijoonit.net\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Artic Computer and Console Museum<\/a> for the picture.

At their time, the Austrian post office even replaces Mupid 1 by Mupid 2s for free (I wonder what they did with all these returned Mupid 1 models). \nThere were 3 Mupid 2 models:\n- C2D (German version of the square tin case with separate keyboard) According to some rumor, these models did not went into sales.\n- C2D2 (German version of the compact case labelled \"Komfort MUPID\")\n- C2A2 (Austrian version of the compact case)\n- In addition there was a Mupid card for early PCs. \nApart from the floppy disc drive, there was one additional option for the Mupid 2.\nThe so-called \"Permanent Memory\" upgraded a normal Mupid 2 to a \"Komfort Mupid\" (it seems that all German C2D2 models were Komfort Mupids). This option consists of a battery-buffered 128 KB CMOS memory that costed an enormous 420 Euro (currently about 650$). This memory allowed either:\n- to store and reload existing Prestel pages without additional costs\n- to store BASIC programs or graphics without other external memory\n- to be used as a RAM disc (this even allowed to run CP\/M without a floppy disc) \n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Fritz Hohl<\/font>",

It was the cheapest Commodore computer ever made.\nBil Herd, the machine''s designer has said, on many occasions, that the original host for the TED was the C116, a $49 machine intended to compete with the Sinclair line of machines.\nThe resulting design was then twisted by management, to become the 1xx, 2xx, and 3xx machines... 116, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=194\">232, 264, 364<\/a> etc respectively (the difference between the 264 and 364 being that the 364 had a numeric keypad AND the Magic Voice cartridge built onto the motherboard) ... \nThe 264 was then taken by management, had productivity software bolted onto it, and it became the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=194\">Plus-4<\/a>, a machine with little Commodore 64 compatibility, costing in the same price range as the Commodore 64. A total fail.\nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=97\">Commodore 16<\/a>, came LATE in the TED''s development lifecycle, when management decided that they needed to have a replacement for the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=252\">VIC-20<\/a>, so they took the VIC-20 cases and keyboards, repainted them, and refactored the TED design to fit in them.\nIt was sold only in Germany and a few East European countries.\nIt came comes with 32 KB of ROM, only 16 KB of RAM and without any built-in software. Like the C16, it didn't have a user port.\nCommodore's hatred for shift keys finds expression in the very early C116's keyboard layout. This time, they made it even worse and removed the LEFT shift key and placed an Esc key there! Not to mention the Inst\/Del key which resided at the SHIFT LOCK key's place. The versions sold later had the Inst\/Del key next to the Home\/Clear key in the top row next to the function keys, the Esc key where you would want it, and thank God, a left shift key again.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Thomas Cherryhomes<\/font>",

        "description": "Almost ten years after having conceived the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=352\">Micral<\/a>, world first commercial microprocessor based computer, Andr? Thi T. Truong, joined the young Normerel Company managed by his old friend Jean Ren? Tissot.\nIn a short time, he designed the OPlite, first computer Normerel would produce. \nThe Oplite was a PC compatible system featuring some innovative concepts. The case held a dual floppy disk drive and a removable 9-inch display. Standard connectors allowed an external colour TV set, a RGB or composite monitor to be used.  The case also provided room for four long expansion cards.\nTo reach a high level of sales, Normerel joined together with Rank Xerox. The OPlite was thus sold in the large French 'Xerox Store's network alongside Apple, Toshiba and other well-known brands.\nLater, Normerel would sell several PC and AT compatible systems. They made a joint-venture with <a href=\"computer.asp?c=506\"> ADDX Syst?mes<\/a> and formed ADDX-Normerel.\nIn 1989, the company which lost a lot of money, was bought by SMT-Goupil. Finally, Normerel closed its doors in July 1998, the same year as SMT.",

        "description": "This is a typical system using catridges based on the different chipsets developped by General Instruments in the late 70s. Each GI chips was able to generate several games, ball games for a start, then later car racing, motorcycle, submarines, tanks and shooting games.\nThe system has two detachable controllers with one analog joystick and one fire button each. The control panel is composed of 10 buttons to select the different games offered by each cartridge (10 being the maximum). Three option switches, a power switch and a RESET button can also be found. There is also a weird color switch\/slider which function is to select one of the 4 display colour combinations (red, purple, blue, green)...\nThe original fact with the PG-7 is that it has an unusual design. Mainly because of the cartridge slot placement, vertically aligned with the control panel. There is no real \"slot\" to insert the whole cartridge, but only a thin connector for the contact edge of the cartridge.\nPlaced a the top of the case can be found a feature usely found on old pong systems but more scarcely on later ones : score sliders to keep track of total winning games for each player. These sliders are not electronicaly connected to anything, there are just \"physical reminders\"...\nAt the back of the system can be found connectors for optional controllers like a light gun, or Battle Tank controllers. In fact both controllers are labeled \"Light Gun 1\" and \"Light Gun 2\", but they must be used by the optional Tank Controllers.\nThe Tank Battle game produced by the AY-3-8710 chip from General Instruments, is often missing from available cartridges for this type of systems (based upon GI chips). There is one good reason. All the other games use analog controllers whereas the Tank Battle must be played with digital controllers (like direction buttons for example). And all these video-game systems were designed with analog controllers and no numeric ones. However, some systems, like the Polycon PG-7 (and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=738\">Prinztronic Micro 5500<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=880\">SHG Blackpoint<\/a>) offered optional digital controllers (pads with 5 buttons: directions and fire) with the Tank Battle cartridge...\nThe Polycon PG-7 is a quite rare little machine.",

        "description": "Basically, the PC-1245 was a low-cost version of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1091\">PC-1251<\/a>.\n \nThe following features were affected: First, it had only 2.2 KB RAM instead of 4 KB, thus only 1486 bytes were available for programming. Second, the display \nprovided only 16 characters instead of 24. Third, the RESERVE mode, which had \nallowed to assign BASIC commands or functions to 18 of the alphanumeric keys, \nhad been eliminated. Instead, these keys were assigned BASIC shortcuts for \neasier program entering.\nAs a cosmetical difference, the colour scheme of the keyboard had been reversed, that is the alphanumeric part was brown and the numeric keypad grey for the PC-1245.\nInternally, the electronics were more or less the same, except for an updated \nROM chip and the eliminated RAM chip. The SC61860 microprocessor, the display \ndriver chip SC43536, the LH532920 ROM and one HM6116 2k x 8 RAM chip were all \nmounted on a single PCB. The 146 bytes of additional RAM were located in the \ndisplay driver chip.\nNeedless to say, that the PC-1245 could use the same peripherals as the PC-1251: The CE-125 thermal printer and micro cassette recorder unit, the CE-126P thermal printer and the CE-124 tape recorder interface.\nSeiko sold a slightly modified versions of the PC-1245, named <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1129\">MC-2200<\/a>\nThanks to <b>Roman von Wartburg<\/b> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\">site<\/a> for information.\nAbout the missing RESERVE-Mode, <b>Joerg Lemmer<\/b> clarifies:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThere ist no Reserve-Position of the switch right to the display on the PC-1245, but you can assign programs to keys on the keyboard using the DEF-Key. Therefore you have to start a program like\n \n10 \"A\": AREAD X: ...\nThis program will then be available in run-mode using <def> <a>, whereas the AREAD-command uses the already displayed value as input and assigns it to variable X. By this it is possible to use the PC-1245 in RUN-mode as a normal calculator and then use the result for a BASIC-routine. That is the main reason for me to have this nice little thing still on my desk.\nI could write books about it and all the fun we (friends in school) had with this thing. We used it to cheat in tests, used undocumented commands to make music with it and even programmed some games.<\/a><\/def><\/font>",

        "description": "The last model of the C64 to be sold was the 64G. It had the original \"breadbin\" case, but the color was much lighter, pretty much the same as on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=998\">64C<\/a> model, to match the tastes of the moment.\nThe keyboard could either be the original black model with graphical symbols on the front side of the keys or the cream colored c-model type with the symbols on top of the keys. It seems that Commodore just tried to use up all the parts that they had in stock which resulted in all kinds of weird color combinations. The motherboard was a small and simplified one, very similar to the the one found in the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1138\">Aldi<\/a> version, though some C64G are reported with more older classic C64 motherboards in them...\nThe SID chip used here is a MOS 8580 version, resulting in sampled sound playing on very low volume. The reason comes from a bug in the older 6581 SID that was removed in the 8580. Eventually a solution was found by grounding one leg of the 8580 through a resistor.\nSome of these machines were made from <a href=\"computer.asp?c=768\">C=64GS<\/a> game console parts when the console bombed. Most were sold with a game pack (some magazine adds show the same game module as with the GS) and was marketed almost as a pure game console which just happened to have a computer in the same package. The G-model kind of replaced the horrible GS.\nBuild quality is not very good, especially the case feels quite brittle. The model sticker says \"Made in W. Germany\", but the motherboards were probably made in Hong Kong in the same factory as the C-model machines and only final assembly was made in Germany. The machine was probably only aimed at the European market.\nThe G-model was clearly a final cheap gaming computer that Commodore made to get rid of the huge stocks of C=64 spares and GS-parts. It was sometimes also named <b>c64-III<\/b> or <b>C64 BN\/E<\/b>.\nThanks to <b>Taneli Lukka<\/b> and <a href=\"http:\/\/retrocomputing.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\">Roman von Wartburg<\/a> for information and pictures",

The 4-line LCD display \nalso had 16 sensitive areas.\nThe computer could be programmed either in Basic or Assembly language. The C61 Basic interpreter, based on Japan Industrial Standard BASIC, had a wide range of built-in mathematic, trigonometric and statistic functions. Assembly programs had to be typed by using the built-in editor then compiled. The user's manual gave little information about CPU instructions and, oddly enough, Casio and it's distributors never released a full description of the whole CPU's instructions set, although Casio published an incomplete \"Technical Reference Manual\".\nThe processor was an Hitachi HDS61700. It contained a small amount of ROM and RAM, as well memory management and I\/O circuitry. The memory was managed like a virtual disk. Several Basic or Assembly programs as well as ASCII text could be stored together in the same RAM area.\nTwo extensions were released for the PB-1000, the FA-7 Serial, Parallel and tape recorder interface, and the rare MD-100 3.5\" floppy drive unit.\nThe PB-1000 was followed by the <b>PB-2000<\/b> which lost the lift up display but had the unique feature of being programmable in ANSI C language.",

        "description": "In October 1995, Be, Inc. unveiled its first  (and last) computer, the BeBox.\nBe was founded in 1990 by Jean-Louis Gass?, former manager of the French Apple subsidiary.\nFor almost 5 years, 12 engineers from Apple, NeXT and Sun designed the BeBox and its operating system, BeOs. The total design cost was about US$9 million. \nBeBox hadware was based on a dual PowerPC 603 C.P.U. running at 66 MHz (later 133 MHz). The motherboard was not really innovative but featured a large range of Input\/Output ports, including IDE and SCSI HDD interfaces, standard PC card slots, MIDI, audio, infrared ports plus a special GeekPort for hardware experiments.\n \nThe Be Operating System was also developed from the ground up. It aimed to be an alternative to the \"Heavy weight\" Windows and Mac OS's, which were handicaped by backward compatibility hardware and software issues. \nBeOs was a clear and clean multi-processor (up to 8), multi-threading, multi-tasking, GUI-based operating system, optimized for digital media management.\nThe first BeBox machines were mainly intended for use by software developers, BeOs was delivered with Metrowerks CodeWarrior and C++ languages. \nIn spite of its numerous advanced features, the BeBox never met the success expected by its designers, mainly because it was compatible with nothing else in the computing industry. Less than 2000 machines were delivered between October 1995 and January 1997, when production ceased.\nIn 1996, BeOs was ported to Apple PowerPC machines but Apple eventually preferred the NeXT basis for its future Mac OS X. Two years later,  BeOs ran on Intel machines.\n \nBecause of the small size of the company and the competition from much larger competitors, the Be adventure finally ended on Novembre 2001 when the company sold all of its intellectual property and technology assets to Palm. Just before this happened, J.L. Gass? offered for free the lastest version of his OS (R5) to Intel PC users. \nNowadays, Although marginal, BeOs is still alive, and new releases and updates are regularly announced by the BeOs community.",

        "description": "Launched in 1976, the Introkit appeared to be very popular. It was the first affordable all-in-one computer everyone could acquire to know a bit about computers.\nThe basic version was really minimalist: one SC\/MP (or \"Scamp\") microprocessor, one 512-byte ROM containing a monitor program and 256 bytes of RAM for user's programs.\nThe system was designed to connect to a Teletype - the CPU had serial In and Out pins, but very few hobbyist could afford this massive and expensive equipment. N.S. thus released an optional display kit which was comprised of an add-on card that fitted onto the main board, and a modified calculator for keyboard and display. The machine also needed a dual voltage PSU\nOnce everything soldered and wire-wrapped, the Introkit was a complete computer and an efficient learning tool. The novice programmer could enter, modify and run programs and thus learn all hardware and software basic concepts of any computing system.\nSeveral of these kits - and other SC\/MP machines, were connected to larger computers thanks to the unique and advanced ability of the SC\/MP CPU to completely share its system bus with other processors, and thus run smoothly in a multiprocessor environment.\nChris Curry took the Introkit as a starting point to design the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=961\">MK-14<\/a> training board, first Sinclair computer.\n<b>Ben Mullett<\/b> recalls:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I joined NSC Bedford in '77 when the SC\/MP was the latest in micros, my first task was to get an Introkit working, with help from Dave Brown. I can still recall some of the Hex opcodes for this machine.... C4 was LDI or 'Load immediate'... \nThe Introkit was indeed a TTY machine, with a modified NSC calculator case and keys forming the (extra cost) KBDkit and a patched ROM to scan the keys.\nThe Introkit\/KBDkit to MK14 development liaison to Science of Cambridge was Tony Amendt, another National Semiconductor Field Applications Engineer.  \nHe helped me get an MK14 running - allegedly the first kit made - since I was fortunate to be given the task of checking out the kit and  instructions.  All that was missing were some pullup resistors on the bus.  Ran well, but what a weird keyboard!  Very Sinclair.....\nThe SC\/MP LCDS was the official development tool - 'Low Cost Development System' and there was a multiprocessing card demo for it that was quite impressive.  Might even have that in my attic somewhere!  \nThe multiprocessing architecture reappeared on the Series 32000 (aka NS16000) micros that were used in the Sequent 'Balance' series of Unix machines a decade later. <\/font>",

        "description": "About Ontel OP-1 systems and Ontel company, <b>Bob Hanrahan<\/b> sent us this testimony:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n<b>Memories of Ontel, Woodbury NY<\/b>\nI worked for Ontel Corporation from 1979 to 1982, designing various controller boards for their line of 8008\/8080\/8085 based computer terminals.\nThe <b>OP-1<\/b> computer family included their high end 64K DRAM system called the <b>OP-1\/64<\/b>. The OP-1\/64 had a 10 card backplane (similar to VME) allowing it to be configured as a terminal, word processor, stand alone computer, etc.\nThe OP-1\/64 (also available as a downgraded version <b>OP-1\/32<\/b> or 48 for 32K or 48K DRAM) was later replaced by the <b>OP-1\/70<\/b> model.  The 8080 CPU card and (2) 32Kbyte RAM memory cards were replaced with a single 8085 based CPU board with on-board 64Kbyte dynamic memory.\nThe OP-1 family employed a discrete DMA controller (Direct Memory Access) allowing fast direct memory transfers to\/from peripheral controllers, significantly reducing CPU overhead for such tasks.  For Word Processing applications Ontel provided a controller called a Word Move Controller (earlier called a Byte String Controller) which provided a method of rapidly inserting or removing characters (bytes) to\/from memory for very efficient text editing.\nThe Intel CPU performance of that era was not powerful enough to perform these tasks using software in a reasonable amount of time.  CPU based string moves for text editing would cause an unacceptable lag when an operator hit the insert or delete keys.  The DMA controller performed transfers at 11 ?Sec\/byte using a TTL based state machine.  I remember designing a prototype DMA controller which moved data at 1.8 ?Sec\/byte, considered fast for 1981!  Ontel was ahead of its time in many areas, advanced Word Processing being one of them.\nDuring 1981, the OP-1\/70 was joined by a lower cost <b>OP-1\/R<\/b> single board version (no card cage) which employed custom IC?s developed by the staff at Ontel.  The OP-1\/R (R stood for remote) looked the same as its big brother yet it could only support a single peripheral controller board, thus it was typically configured as a remote slave terminal with basic features.\nLater we introduced the <b>OP-1\/50<\/b> which included 2 integrated 5.25\" floppy drives with a smaller card cage in the same plastics.  Finally around 1982 we introduced the <b>OP-1\/15<\/b> which was the first system to take on a new more modern look.  The OP-1\/15 used the same basic OP-1 backplane architecture, saving space with a much smaller and lighter switching power supply.\nThe OP-1 was custom configured and often custom painted for a specific customer.  Large customers included Olivetti, Telefunken, CDC, would sell the systems with their own software for a specific application under their own name.\nThe Ontel systems were designed and built by a group of very talented (and fun) employees in Woodbury NY (Long Island). Much adrenalin ran through the company, from engineering right down to the production floor all knew we were involved with something big, something that would grow over time.\nOntel expanded rapidly during the period from 1979 to 1982, from about 200 employees (15 engineers) to about 900 (90 engineers).  The founder and president at that time was <u>David Ophire<\/u> (where the system name OP-1 came from) who I believe came out of ADDS. During 1981 the company was sold from <u>Ceasers World<\/u> (owners of Ceasers Palace) to a group whose name escapes me.  David and other executives were replaced by a new management team which seemed to dampen the innovative culture that existed at the time.\nDuring 1982 we were planning to move to a higher performance (and cost) 16 bit system which was to employ new color graphics technology becoming available in new video IC?s.  We evaluated the Zilog Z8000, Mot 68000, NS 16000 (later called the 32000), and the Intel 8086.  Intel won, not based on performance.  I don?t believe a 16 bit machine was ever sold by Ontel.\nOntel had a very strong software team who designed a very sophisticated development platform, allowing customers and third party programmers to develop system applications. The team also developed diagnostics that provided sophisticated self test and debug facilities used to ensure high quality in a system of this complexity.\nThe Ontel OP-1 series employed an internally developed Operating System which was ported to a tape drive during their early year, then to an external 8\" floppy, and later 5.25\" floppy drives.  Options included large CDC drive systems for large data center applications (96 MByte total on 6 large 18? platters!).\nThe DOS looked much like the MS-DOS PC development platform not yet developed at that time.  The team ported an early version of MS Basic, I recall when Bill Gates and Paul Allen visited Ontel to install and sell the package around 1980, kids at that time.   During the peak we were selling around 10K systems\/year.  Around 1982 the company was sold to <u>Visual Technology<\/u>, a Boston based company who eventually closed the doors on the Woodbury Long Island facility.\nWe learned a lot at Ontel and I truly enjoyed the time shared with so many great people.  Having lost contact with all but a few, I still think about many of them.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Tele-Ball VIII is one of the many Tele-Ball systems from MBO (a famous electronic german brand from Munich), though this particular model is one of the last (maybe the last) from the range.\nEarly Tele-Ball systems were pure pong machines, whereas the Tele-Ball VIII offers 4 pong games (tennis, soccer, squash, practice), 2 shooting games and 2 car racing games thanks to its F-4301 chipset from Universal Research Labs. Of course these car racing games were the main marketing asset of the Tele-Ball VIII !\nHere is what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pong-story.com<\/a> says about this chipset :\n<font color=\"#666666\">In 1976, Universal Research Labs (URL) released a relatively well designed chip: the F4301. This chip played two PONG variants and two car racing games. The car games were a major addition since no other PONG chip played them. The F4301 games could be played by up to four players (\"human mode\"), and the pong games could also be played against the system (\"robot\" mode) with variable \"intelligence\" (\"paddle reaction\" time). URL used this chip in their Indy 500 system, released in 1976. Atari also used it in the Speedway systems, sold under the Sears label (Sears also released an INDY 500 system). Some european systems also used this chip (Interton Video 2800, MBO Tele-Ball VIII, etc). Because the chip was so complex, it could not fit a single silicon piece and had to be split in two pieces mounted on a thick film substrate. URL contracted Omnetics Inc. to do this, hence the Omnetics label on the chip.<\/font>\nAs stated above the F4301 offers two pong games, but it is not clear if the Tele-Ball VIII uses these or the ones offered by its built-in AY-3-8500 chipset to offer its pong games... Apparently it would use the F4302 chipset only for its car racing games, the AY-3-8500 powering the classic pong games.\nFollowing our philisophy, the Tele-Ball VIII is not listed as a pong machines because it offers more than pure pongs games.\nApart from that, it has all the characteristics of the Tele-Ball pong systems: two detachable controllers with dials, switches to set game options and a vertical slider to select the different games.",

        "description": "<b>3DO Interactive Multiplayer<\/b> is the name of a number of video game consoles released in 1993 and 1994 by Panasonic, Sanyo and Goldstar. The consoles were manufactured according to specifications created by The 3DO Company which were originally designed at the New Technology Group (which later became part of the 3DO Company) by Dave Needle and RJ Mical. After leaving EA Games, Trip Hawkins originally came up with the idea of the 3DO Multiplayer system.\nThe consoles had very advanced hardware features at the time: an ARM60 32-bit RISC CPU, two custom video co-processors, a custom 16-bit DSP and a custom math coprocessor. They also featured 2 megabytes of DRAM, 1 megabyte of VRAM, and a double speed CD-ROM drive for main storage, Up to 8 controllers could be daisy-chained on the system at once. In addition to special 3DO software, the system was able to play audio CDs (including support for CD+G), view Photo CDs, and Video CDs with an add-on MPEG video card (released in Japan only). However, few titles utilized the console's full potential, which, along with its high price (699.95 USD at release) and the inability of the console market to sustain multiple platforms, put it in an early grave. The final nail in the coffin was the scuttling of the project after the expensive development of the successor console, the <b>M2<\/b>.\nIt can be said that the 3DO software library exhibits some of the worst aspects of home video games at the time, even if there are a few gems. This was the dawn of CD-ROM gaming, so cutscenes of pixelated video footage dominated many titles at the expense of good gameplay. The best titles were usually ports of games from other systems--including Alone in the Dark,Myst, Out of This World, and Star Control II. Other notable titles include Need For Speed, Cannon Fodder, Slayer, Killing Time, and the first console port of Super Street Fighter II Turbo, which exceeded the original with its CD-quality audio. Game series that started on 3DO by Electronic Arts, Studio 3D0 and Crystal Dynamics established themselves on other 32-bit consoles.\nIn addition to the consoles, a 3DO Blaster ISA peripheral card for PCs which offered all the features of the home console was manufactured by Creative Technology.\nThe 3DO Company also designed a next-generation console called the <b>M2<\/b>, which was to use a PowerPC 602 processor, but the company abandoned the console business and sold the technology to Matsushita who never brought the system to the market.\nThe Goldstar 3DO console was released in the US and Korea at a MSRP of \n$399.  Goldstar expanded distribution of the 3DO system by making it \navailable through mass merchandisers and toy stores.\nIt has been noted that a few games seem to have a problem with the\nearly model Goldstar units. Cyberia, PO'ed, and The Horde lock up during \ncertain sections of the game. This is most likely due to the fact that early \nmodel Goldstar units could not handle files over a certain size.\n_________________\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThis article is licensed under the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/fdl.html\" target=\"_blank\">GNU Free Documentation License<\/a>.\nIt uses material from the Wikipedia article which can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.classicgaming.com\/museum\/faqs\/3dofaq.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">3DO FAQ<\/a>.\n<\/font>",

You sould read its entry for more info about the Mustang itself.\nThe Mustang 9016 is thus a programmmable console which looks like a pong system, the most popular systems when the RCA Studio appeared. Like the Studio II, the Mustang 9016 seems to also have 5 built in games: Bowling, Freeway (car racing), Patterns, Doodles, and Math (any confirmation would be nice).\nThe controllers are quite basic: only two numeric keypads built-in the system, labeled \"A\" for left player and \"B\" for right player. The numeric keypads are composed of ten keys numbered from 0 to 9. Arrows are also drawn next to the keys to indicate that \"4\" is for left, \"6\" for right, \"2\" for up, \"3\" for up-right, etc. \"0\" is thus often used as the fire button (depending on games of course).\nSome years after RCA Studio II was released, color clone systems like the Mustang 9016 appeared in Europe.  They were clearly marketed as cheap systems for people who couldn't afford more \"modern\" systems like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=755\">Colecovision<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1018\">Vectrex<\/a>.  They include the Soundic MPT-02 Victory, Hanimex MPT-02, Mustang 9016 Telespiel Computer, Conic M-1200 and the Sheen 1200 Micro Computer.  Some have modifications from the original RCA Studio II such as detachable controllers or even color graphics.  There were also some new cartridges produced for these systems, such as Concentration Match for the MPT-02 systems. The Mustang 9016 has no detachable controllers but offers color display.\nIt is interesting to notice that MPT-02 systems are Studio RCA 2 software-compatible, MPT-03 are <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Emerson Arcadia 2001<\/a> software-compatible and MPT-04\/05 systems are <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> software-compatible systems...\nIf you want to learn more about the RCA Studio II and its clones, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/magazine\/view.asp?r=2&amp;a=5\">here<\/a>.\nThe <a href=\"computer.asp?c=543\">RCA Cosmac VIP<\/a> computer is also quite related to the RCA Studio II and clones.",

There were two flavors of this machine: the <b>7300<\/b>, and the <b>3B1<\/b>. Basically the circuitry is identical in both machines however the 3B1 allowed more room for hard-drive storage, as shown with the ominous bulge underneath the screen. (not shown in model above).\nThe windowing manager was absolutely wonderful keeping the UNIX system well hidden, however, you could naturally open a shell and interface directly. The graphics system was neat as well - there is a 3D bitmap demo online somewhere. \nThese computers could support 3 terminals with an add-on card for concurrent use by up to 4 users (one at he console, one on the built-in port, and one each on the two add-on ports).\nThe keyboard could be \"nested\" on the shelf in front of the floppy drive. The sound was limited to beeps. \nThere was also an add-on board with a speech synthesizer which could turn the UnixPC into a full-fleged voicemail management system.\nAn absolutely wonderful and advanced computer for it's time, which can still teach modern computers a lesson in innovation.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Domenic Schipani, Gary Clouse<\/font>",

Several switches control game options (speed, player sizes, service automatic or manual). Finally, two orange buttons are used to reset the system and to serve manually (the ball).\nOn top of the case are two sliders (one for each players) used to keep track of a two players tournament scores. The controllers are detachable but can be stored in the plastic case of the system itself. There are made of an analog joystick and a fire button. \nThe system offers two shooting games. These are played with the standard controllers - the stick moves a 'cursor' block on the screen and another block move accross the screen from left to right to represent the target. The fire button is the trigger.\nThe XK 410C uses the same plastic case as the Polycon game systems (see <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1128\">Polycon PG-7<\/a> for example).",

        "description": "The PC-1401 was the first of a series of pocket computers with a new concept.\nIt combined the advantages of a BASIC programmable pocket computer and a scientific calculator. Nevertheless, it was much thinner than, for instance, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=965\">PC-1500<\/a>, and well worth its price.\nTherefore, the PC-14xx series was very successful, especially among students.\nThe PC-1401 was developed based on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1091\">PC-125x<\/a> series, thus it\npossessed the same BASIC core capabilities. In addition, it had a separate\ncalculator mode, in which it could be used like any of Sharp's scientific\ncalculators, such as the EL506H.\nFor this purpose, the right section of the keyboard had 18 additional math keys, and it could be used as any standard AOS entry calculator. Moreover, a set of statistics functions was implemented.\nIn BASIC mode, the additional math buttons could be used as shortcut keys to enter the BASIC keywords of these math functions. A downside was the small display with only 16 characters, which made it somewhat hard to keep track of your BASIC program while programming.\nAs the PC-125x series, the PC-1401 was based on the SC61860 8-bit CMOS\nmicroprocessor, clocked with a 576 kHz ceramic resonator circuit, and the same\ndisplay driver chip (SC43536). It had 4.2 KB RAM (two HM6116 2k x 8 chips plus\nsome bytes in the display driver chip) and 40 KB ROM (SC613256). All chips and\nother components were soldered onto a single PCB. The RAM of the PC-1401 could\nnot be extended by modules.\nThe PC-14xx series consisted of various models; here, only those directly\nderived from the PC-125x hardware are described. At least three different models were widely available in the West:\n<b>PC-1401<\/b>: This was the first machine of the series, released in 1983.\n<b>PC-1402<\/b>: Released about one year later. Basically the same machine, but\nwith more RAM. One of the HM6116 chips had been replaced by a D4364G 8k x 8\nchip, resulting in 10.2 KB RAM (9678 bytes for BASIC).\n<b>PC-1421<\/b>: This machine was also released in 1984. As the PC-1401, it had\n4.2 KB RAM (3454 for BASIC). However, it was powered by a later release of the\nCPU and clocked with a higher clock rate (768 kHz), which made it one third\nfaster. From the software's point of view,it was equipped with special math\nfunctions for business\/financial matters.\nTogether with the PC-1401, the CE-126P thermal printer and micro cassette\ninterface unit was introduced.

A low price point and extremely low battery consumption is considered to be the original vision of Yokoi. Sadly, Yokoi died in a car accident before seeing a completed WonderSwan. \nMost of the games for the WonderSwan were based on Japanese Anime series. The system had no success outside of the Japanese domestic market, mainly beacause it was not ditributed and marketed efficiently. One of the system's interesting features is the control layout allows for games to be played in either vertical or horizontal position. \nOther than the original WonderSwan's lack of color support it was a brilliantly engineered system. Shame it didn't have success outside of Japan. \n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Author : Yuki Itada<\/font>",

It was often done that a 1200 model would have a drive added by the dealer, as it was sometimes less expensive to add the Teac 5.25\" disk drive than buy the 1250, or often the 1200s were more available in stock. \nThe Sanyo MBC-1250 was the last CP\/M-80 computer Sanyo sold to the US Business System market. Preceding it were the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1072\">MBC-1000 series<\/a> and the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=902\">MBC-1100 series<\/a>, all of which had integral monitors.

        "description": "IBM had little luck with it's portable models, and realized to keep up, they needed a laptop. IBM came up with the 5140, it was a laptop that could be converted into a main desktop in seconds.\nThe LCD screen detaches for a color CRT to be attached. IBM didn't sell many of these due to the fact the LCD was not backlit, and conpetition was less expensive.\nThe IBM 5140 was available in two models, the 2 and the 22; the only difference being the 22 came with diagnostics software. IBM saw little success from this machine due to high costs, slow processor at 4.77 MHz, hard to read screen, and cumbersome size. Both models were expandable to 640KB RAM with third party upgrades.\nThis laptop is unique however because it used static memory, instead of dynamic memory. The static memory was more reliable, and gave the CPU 7% more processing power.\nThere were three distinct display models for the IBM 5140. One was the standard 10? monochrome LCD, which was hard to read. Later on IBM changed this to a super twist LCD, which was much easier to read.\nThe first CRT option was an IBM 5144 monochrome display, which was easy to read, it came with a stand, ac power cord, and CRT adaptor for the 5140. The second and final option was an IBM 5145 color display, which was easy to read as well, it came with a stand, ac power cord, and CRT adaptor for the 5140. The CRT monitors sat atop a stand which was placed over the 5140, the 5140 then could be slid in and out from under the monitor stand for easy conversion. The LCD screen that attaches via proprietary connection could be disconnected and removed easily with the push of a button.\nThere is a 72 pin port on the back of the unit for several expansions; serial, parallel, and CRT interfaces were available.\nThese computers also came with a small, direct-attach thermal printer that was same width, height, etc as the computer so you could carry computer, printer and all by the one handle.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Alex Rushing<\/b> for info and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computercloset.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.computercloset.org<\/a> for the picture.<\/font>",

        "description": "IBM was struggling in 1986 against Apple's Macintosh series, so IBM set out to create something that would defeat the Macintosh. IBM came up with a all-in-one similar to the Macintosh. However, the Model 25 &amp; 30 were the low-end (budget) models of the PS\/2 range.\nThe PS\/2 Model 25 became quite popular with businesses, but never made it strong with the home market.\nThe PS\/2 Model 25 &amp; 30 were the only system using the MCGA (Multicolor Graphics Adapter) standard. They came with this video features built-in. MCGA offered all text and graphic modes of the CGA standard plus 640x480 monochrome and 320x200, 256 colors (out of a palette of 262,144). It announced the future VGA standard which will become much more popular.\nModel 25 &amp; 30 were also the only PS\/2 systems using an 8-bit ISA bus (like PC ATs), as opposed to other PS\/2 models which used a 16 or 32 bit MCA bus.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>Alex Rushing<\/b> for info and picture<\/font>\nFurther information from <b>Brandon<\/b>:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe model 25 came in two models, a monochrome model, and a color model.  The monochrome model usually is called \"Type 001\", the color one being \"Type 004\"..  There never was a type 002, or 003.\nThe motherboard for the color and black and white models are exactly the same, minus some revisions on the later years.  They were always surface mounted though (most of the chips anyway).\nThey are a tough machine, though when you install one in a new room, it NEEDS to let sit in the room for a couple hours, otherwise the power supply\/motherboard will die.\nWhile the floppy drives were 720KB, they \"could\" use 1.44MB drives, as long as the interface was the same.\nThey contain TWO BIOS's in them.  One called the CBIOS, and the other called the ABIOS.. CBIOS is \"Compatible BIOS\", and is used for DOS or Windows 3.0 and under...  ABIOS, or \"Advanced BIOS\", is used when it runs OS\/2..  OS\/2 is the native OS to this unit. They also had an option for a hard drive.<\/font>",

Machines were made, but whether they were under license or not is not known in any detail. It is thought that they assembled parts shipped from the UK. I have a contact in Yugoslavia who says there were several in his village and about 30 in a school in the next village. This may suggest that more than 5000 were made. They were known as the Oric Nova 64 and were Atmos based.\"<\/i>\nThus, the NOVA 64 seems to be an exact Atmos machine, only the \"NOVA 64\" label being different. But we hadn't the chance to test one yet to confirm this statement. The motherboard however seems a bit different from well known Issue 3 &amp; 4 ones used in most official Oric machines (RAM chips layout is different).\nThe 64 in \"Nova 64\" comes from the fact the Atmos has really 64 KB RAM, but \n16 KB are masked by the ROM at startup, thus leaving \"only\" 48 KB to work with the Basic language.\n_________________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Ranko Vukcevic for the pictures.<\/font>",

        "description": "This obscure videogame system was made by Voltmace, a British company based in Baldock. Voltmace came into being in 1977 as a pure sales\/marketing organisation - it offered sales facilities to companies who had a product to sell. They were contracted by one of the early pionneers in the video field to handle their product.\nShortly after this, Voltmace came into contact with Teleng who were putting out one of the first programmable machines and there ensued a short but profitable association during which Voltmace sold many of the British made game machines. But later Teleng's parent company decided to close down the factory in Essex and gradually run down video game production in the U.K.\nEventually, in 1980 Voltmace approached the Videomaster arm of the Waddington's company with a view to marketing their Database game machine - which was at the time being made in Hong Kong.\nTheir first season with the Database was quite successful and when, in early '81, the chance came to purchase the machine in its entirety, Voltmace jumped at the chance.\nThey could at last produce a British made video games machine in their Baldock factory and it was quickly arranged for all the tooling machinery to be shipped over from Hong Kong - by June '81 all the hardware needed was in Baldock and staff were recruited to start production.\nOne of the drawbacks of the Database machine when it was being made in Hong Kong was a certain reputation for unreliability. Voltmace tried to resolve that by strict quality-control and good after-sales service. But the Database couldn't resist long enough against competitors like <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Intellivision<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=755\">Colecovision<\/a>, and the '83 videogame industry crash surely doomed the Voltmace adventure...\nThe other noteworthy Voltmace products were joysticks for popular micro-computers, mainly BBC systems. There were in fact Database controllers modified to be used with other systems.\nIn fact the Database is software compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> and \"clones\". This doesn't mean that it can use the Interton cartridges, as they won't fit, but the internal specs and software are the same. The CPU is the 2650A from Signetics and the Video Controller is the 2636 from Signetics as well.\nAbout 40 cartridges has been released for the Interton VC-4000, but only 29 were available for the Database... It seems that a converter was available to play Interton cartridges on a Voltmace Database! Surprisingly, original games for the Database were programmed by Derek Andrews at the time : Leap-Frog, Crunch and a Defender clone (never released). See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/magazine\/view.asp?r=6&amp;a=15\">Derek's interview<\/a> for more information.\nLike with all the systems of the \"Interton family\", there are two controllers with 12 buttons keypad + 2 fire buttons + a joystick. Controllers were designed to use informative plastic layers delivered with each games, used to show the function of each key. The control panel is composed of an ON\/OFF switch and 3 buttons (Reset program, Select Game, Start Game).  \n____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <b>David Elvin<\/b> for most info<\/font>",

        "description": "The Intervision 3001 is one of the many systems \"software-compatible\" with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Emerson Arcadia 2001<\/a>. Visually, it is the same system as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1191\">Intervision 2001<\/a>.\nOn the electronic board of the Intervision 3001 can be found this inscription : \"<b>M1800 11-0253-10 Rev A<\/b>\". Several systems of the \"Arcadia family\" are based on this generic M1800 electronic board. This shows that the hardware was conceived by one company (in Hong Kong ? Soundic ? Radofin ?) and then sent to others companies for assembly and specific marketing (see <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1189\">Voltmace Database<\/a> story for another example of the phenomenon). But the name of original company is not known until now, and no generic M1800 system has been found so far. Some game boxes labeled with \"can be used with M1800 system\" exist, but there was always a sticker upon it replacing M1800 with the name of another system. Thus even with the games, it looks like the parent company sent ready to be marketed games &amp; boxes where each company had to put their own sticker upon them.\nSoundic seems to be such a company which built MPT-x systems and then sold them to other companies to do their own marketing. Many obscure consoles are in fact based on MPT-x electronic board. MPT-02 were <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=728\">RCA Studio II<\/a> clones, MPT-03 were \"<a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Arcadia 2001<\/a> clones\" and MPT-04 &amp; MPT-05 were \"<a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> clones\".\nThe Intervision 3001 is a rare machine! One was found in spain and another in Switzerland where the 2001 model was distributed too. The Intervision 2001 was also sold in Finland so it wouldn't be a surprise to discover a 3001 model there too one day.\nSee the Intervision 2001 entry for more info about the system itself...\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lomasretro.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.lomasretro.com<\/a> for the pictures<\/font>",

        "description": "The Intervision 2001 is one of the many systems \"software-compatible\" with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Arcadia 2001<\/a> or the MPT-03 systems to name a few.\nThough, the Emerson Arcadia 2001 is the maybe most popular system of this console group, it was not necessarily at the origin of it. Things must be seen differently. Philips \/ Signetics developped a hardware platform to demonstrate the possibilities of their Signetics 2650 &amp; 2636 chipsets. Somehow, this hardware was licenced to many third-companies around the world resulting in systems like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1189\">Voltmace DataBase<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=906\">Acetronic MPU-1000<\/a>, Radofin 1292, etc. Most electronic boards of these systems were build in Asia by companies such as Radofin or Soundic.\nSome times later, the hardware was improved, with the use of a Signetics 2637 instead of the 2636 (handling the audio &amp; video), somehow resulting in a new wave of licenced systems, all based on the same hardware and playing the same games. This is what is the Intervision 2001. This console group includes : the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Emerson Arcadia 2001<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1181\">Advision Home-Arcade<\/a>, MPT-03 systems, M1800 systems, Tele-Fever, etc.\nAll these systems (based on the 2650 &amp; 2637 chipsets) are \"software-compatible\" with each others. It means that they all could play each other games if their cartridge slots were identical (which is not the case, resulting in sub-groups).\nThe Intervision 2001 was marketed at least in Finland and Switzerland. It's very similar to the Sheen Home Video Centre 2001 (Australia) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=829\">Ormatu Video Spelcomputer 2001<\/a> (Netherlands). These two use the same plastic case and have M1800 motherboards.\nThe Intervision 2001 is equiped with two detachable controllers made of a screwable analog joystick and a 14-buttons keypad (rubber buttons). Small plastic layers were delivered with each game, explaining the different key functions when placed over the keypads (like with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellivision<\/a>).\nThe Control panel is made of 4 buttons (Start, Clear, Select A and Select B) and the power switch.\nThe Intervision 2001 was followed by an <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1190\">Intervision 3001<\/a> model which look similar in every points. Maybe there is a difference on the motherboard. Can anyone confirm this ?",

It uses the same plastic case as many other europeans systems of that time. With its 10 games, this must be one of the most sophisticated videogame systems based on General Instruments chipsets. The AY-3-8512 chip offers the 4 pong games and 2 shooting games, while the AY-3-8760 offers the 4 motor-cycle games.\nAttached to the console are two paddles (with no fire button). Service is automatic or set via the buttons on the system panel. Another controller can be connected to the back of the Tele-Partner in order to play the motor-cycle games. In the same way, if you want to play shooting games, you must connect the light-gun sold (?) with the system.\nThe box of this particular system seems to be generic for all other Tele-Partner models (or systems conceived by the same Hong-Kong manufacturer) as it shows games not available for this console (see More Picture pages) : Tank Battle and Hockey (with horizontal movements).

        "description": "Visual was the 5th largest manufacturer of office graphics terminals. They once thought they could design a nice IBM PC clone (which they did) and sell it with their terminals (which they didn't). It turned out that Visual's salesmen weren't equipped to sell computers and Visual had put too much money into these computers (the built-in color graphics, a terminal mode, 2 disk drives, etc.) to sell them at stripped down prices. So Visual sold them all to DAK (a popular US electronic reseller) and took an enormous loss.\nThe Visual 1083, also known as the \"Commuter\" is an interesting machine. It is an early MS-DOS system, thus considered as <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a> compatible. It could even be the first \"IBM PC\" portable computer equiped with a LCD display !\nIndeed the particularity of the Commuter is to be able to a use detachable (and optional) LCD display (80x16 characters, monochrome) or a more classic RGB monitor (80x25 characters).\nThe LCD display can flip up and down to make the system portable. Thanks to its big sturdy handle, the \"Commuter\" can thus be easily carried away. The case being completely closed, the computer turns into a practical suitcase (see \"more pictures\" page).\nBuilt-in the system are two 5.25\" disk drives offering 360 KB each. The 83 key keyboard is identical to IBM's PC, except for the addition of lights on the \"Caps Lock\" and \"Num Lock\" keys.\nThe computer could be expanded by adding custom cards. There is an expansion port that can be directly connected to an IBM expansion chassis.\nWhen turned on, the computer shows the following menu :\nB - BOOT FROM DRIVE A\nE - EXTENDED DIAGNOSTICS\nS - SETUP TERMINAL PARAMETERS\nT - TERMINAL MODE\nFunny to see that the choices make : BEST ...\n__________\n<b>Harland LaVigne<\/b> reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">I was executive VP of Custom Computer Systems located in Marlboro MA.

In 1983, it was the first project of this nature.\nThe P?riminitel itself is thus only a computer case with the mother board and the built-in floppy disk drives. You then have to connect your Minitel terminal to get the display and keyboard.\nThe display specifications are those of the Videotex: 40x25 characters and semi-graphics characters.\nThe system is programmed via a Basic language and controled by a special operating system called Alice, specificaly developped to work with the Minitel built-in modem. The computer can thus offer all kind of functions related to videotex browsing such as saving the pages to disk or memory. A printer can also be connected to print the different screens visited. But the P?riminitel can also act as a Videotex server or a messaging system.\nThe P?riminitel can of course also be used as a \"normal\" computer, running local applications. Telmi, for example, developped a program for Pharmacists: their P?riminitel could send account information to their banks and to the Social Security center via the Minitel modem.\nThe main drawbacks are the limited specifications of the Videotex display compared to the price of the P?riminitel, and the limited transfer rate of the Minitel built-in modem (1200 bauds).\nTelmi only sold 200 P?riminitels from July 1983 to January 1985.",

It boots from one floppy drive (DOS) while the 2nd floppy is used for data and programs you may wish to run.  It has a NEC V20 8-bit processor which is switchable between 7.16 MHz and 4.77 MHz.  It also has a CGA backlit LCD screen (monochrome), optional built in modem (1200 baud), math coprocessor and standard serial and parallel ports.  It also has a DB-9 CGA port and RCA composite port for use with an external display.\nThere are LED indicators for Caps Lock, Num Lock, Low Battery, Scroll Lock and Standby Mode. Special features (for the time) includes battery-powered clock &amp; calendar, standby mode and internal speakers.\nThe first member of the 1400 serie is called the <b>LT<\/b>. The <b>FD<\/b> and <b>HD<\/b> models were released later (1988?). The FD having two 3.5'' disk drives and the HD one 3.5'' disk drive + one built-in hard disk (20 MB).\nThe only differences between LT and FD model are : FD has an external floppy drive connector, no composite video output and only one internal slot (for modem). The case is almost identical though the FD is lighther. The HD is an FD model with a 20 MB hard drive built-in instead of the 2nd floppy drive.\nThe LT was delivered with Tandy DOS 3.2003 or 3.2004, and the FD &amp; HD with Tandy DOS 3.3004.\n_______________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to Alex Rushing...<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1197\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "This is a typical system using catridges based on the different chipsets developped by General Instruments in the late 70s. Each GI chips was able to generate several games, ball games for a start, then later car racing, motorcycle, submarines, tanks and shooting games.\nThe system has two detachable controllers with one analog joystick and one fire button each. A big numbered dial in the middle of the control panel is used to select the different games offered by each cartridge (10 being the maximum). Three option switches (A,B,C), a power switch and a RESET button can also be found.\nThe original fact with the Teleng Colourstars is its unusual design. First, it looks like a classic pong systems, but when looking closer, there is a cartridge slot on the right side of the system (unusual placement for a cartridge slot).\nSeven games seem to have been released for the Teleng Coloustars: Ball\/Paddle, Submarines, Space War, Wipe out, Stunt Cycle, Tank Battle and Road Race.\nThe Tank Battle game produced by the AY-3-8710 chip from General Instruments, is often missing from available cartridges for this type of systems (based upon GI chips). There is one good reason. All the other games use analog controllers whereas the Tank Battle must be played with digital controllers (like direction buttons for example). And all these video-game systems were designed with analog controllers and no numeric ones. However, some systems, like the Teleng Colourstars (and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1128\">Polycon PG-7<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=738\">Prinztronic Micro 5500<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=880\">SHG Blackpoint<\/a>) offered optional digital controllers (pads with 5 buttons: directions and fire) with the Tank Battle cartridge...\nThe Stunt Cycle cartridge can normally be played with default controllers as it only require vertical movements for acceleration, but Teleng offered with the cartridge a special one made of a simple vertical slider, which is quite uncommon for this type of system.\nThe Teleng Colourstars was also marketed as the Mercury Commander, Sovriegn, Replay and Teleplay",

They include: 4 motorbike games, 2 shooting games, Solo, Gridball, Pelota, Football, Basketball, Tennis, Ice Hockey and Squash. As usual with these kind of systems, games are powered by single specialised chips. The 4 motor bike games are generated by the AY-3-8760 chipset from General Instruments and the other ones (shooting + pong) by the AY-3-8610 from the same manufacturer (if someone can confirm this by opening their 4014 console it would be nice).\nThe two detachable controllers (hardwired to the systems electronic board) are composed of an analog joystick and two buttons: serve and reset. The games selection is made by pressing one of the 14 buttons located on the control panel. Several switches are used to change the different options, including the size of the paddles, speed of the game and the difficulty level.\nThe 2 shooting games seem to be played only with the joysticks.

        "description": "In 1986 Psion launched their second pocket computer, the Organiser II. \nInitially there were two models: the 8K RAM model <b>CM<\/b> and the 16K model \n<b>XP<\/b>.  Both had a 32K ROM containing simplistic software, including a card\nfile database, diary and clock.  Less simplistic was the OPL programming \nlanguage, a semi-compiled structured language allowing full use of the \nmachine's features.  It was this that principally guaranteed the \nmachine's success.  Later, the XP was upgraded to 32K RAM for the U.S. \nmarket, and given the model name <b>LA<\/b>, though the cases still bore the \nlegend \"XP\".\nIn 1989, two upgraded models were released, the <b>LZ<\/b> and <b>LZ64<\/b>.  These \nfeatured an enlarged 20x4 display, a choice of 32K or 64K RAM, and a 64K \nROM containing more sophisticated diary and card file software, along \nwith a notepad application.  The OPL language was upgraded with a few \nextra statements to take advantage of the machine's capabilities (and to \nrectify a few omissions from the CM\/XP's built-in language).\nExpansion was through a proprietary connector in the top of the machine, \nprotected by a sliding door.  Bar code readers and a thermal printer \nwere available.  Memory expansion was through a pair of expansion slots \nin the back of the machine.  \"Rampaks\" were simple battery-backed RAM \nexpansions.  \"Datapaks\" were EPROMs which acted as write-once-read-many \ndrives and were formatted with an external formatter device - a simple \nUV light with timer that erased the EPROMS.  \"Flashpaks\" were EEPROMs, \nwhich acted similarly to Datapaks but could be formatted using the Psion \nitself.  Software was supplied on Datapaks, or occasionally PROMs.  The \nmodel CM could use only Datapaks.\nThe Organiser II range was used in a wide variety of environments, \nincluding retail and industrial environments in which its hardy case was \nparticularly valuable.  It was superseded as a PDA in 1991 when Psion \nbrought out the Series 3 range, but continued to be manufactured until \nthe late 1990s.  Their robust design may well allow them to continue \nfunctioning long after the later Series 3 and 5 range machines are \nbeyond repair.\nThanks to <b>Damian Walker<\/b> for information and picture.",

It was designed and produced by Multitech in Ta?wan which would eventually become Acer in 1987.\nMultitech was then specialised in such small computers used to study electronic principles and micro-processors. The <a href=\"computer.asp?c=479\">MPF-I<\/a> was based on the Z80 CPU, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1132\">MPF-I\/88<\/a> on the Intel 8088 CPU,  the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1133\">Microkit 09<\/a> on the Motorola 6809 CPU and thus the MPF-I\/65 on the MOS Technology 6502. All popular chipsets of the time were then covered.\nThe MPF-I\/65 offers 64 KB RAM and 16 KB ROM. It is directly programmed in machine language, no Basic here. The 16 KB ROM thus contains assembler, editor and debugger tools to assist the programmer in its task. On the contrary of other MPF-I systems, there is no built-in LCD display. An external display must be attached to use the computer.\nWhat is interesting about this computer is that it looks A LOT like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=276\">MPF-II<\/a>. Same CPU, same calculator type keyboard and most of all identical motherboard. It all seems like it was a pre-version of the MPF-II system, which is itself more advanced (built-in Basic, graphical possibilities, etc.). But the MPF-II was released in 1982, and first adverts of the MPF-I\/65 appeared late 1984 (at least in France)...\nSo it could be the contrary: the MPF-I\/65 being a simplified version of the MPF-II to meet the needs of an initiation computer based on the Motorola 6502 CPU.

        "description": "The Intellivision was developed by Mattel Electronics, a subsidiary of toy company Mattel (yes, the same people that make the famous \"Barbie doll\"), specifically to get a foot into the arriving and profitable market of electronic games. The Intellivision arrived in 1979 boasting technology that far outstripped any of the competitors, so much so that it was the first real challenge to <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari<\/a>. Like Atari, Mattel also marketed their console to retailers as a rebadged unit. These models include the Radio Shack Tandyvision, the GTE-Sylvania Intellivision, and the Sears Super Video Arcade.\nUsing a General Instruments CP1610 processor, Intellivision was the first 16-bit game console. The data bus was only 10 bits wide but the processor internally ran with 16 bits at 894.886 kHz with 1352 bytes of RAM. The games were stored on 4-8k ROM insertable cartridges. The strongest market for the device was in sports video games where it offered superior graphics and sound.\nBy early 1982 Mattel had boasted a machine that sold over 2 million units, making them some $100 million US and a growing library of games that would eventually reach some 129 titles and more titles if you include 3rd party developers.\nMattel also developed a ?System Changer?, an attachable device that allowed the direct play of Atari games that saw them as one of the first to successfully win a lawsuit against Atari who sued because of the invention.\nIntellivision was the second video game system with a Voice Synthesis module (?IntelliVoice?), and had what was probably the first Cable Modem in the form of ?PlayCable? that allowed users to download Intellivision games direct off a special TV channel.\nThe Intellivision?s unique controllers allowed natural player movement in 16 directions with overlays used for each individual game, allowing the controller to be reprogrammable.\nAfter the arrival of IntelliVision II: Mattel would drop their attempt at the ?Keyboard Component? (the IntelliVision computer) for the ?ECS?, an updated design that attached to the system and also failed commercially due to poor design. Mattel then invested in the equally failed <a href=\"computer.asp?c=73\">Aquarius<\/a> home computer.\nOn Jan 20, 1984, and after selling 6 million units and loosing $300 million, Mattel closed the Intellivision project when the ?video game crash? came into full force. The remaining inventory eventually falling to the hands of former Intellivision programmers who went on with the project in the form of <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1209\">INTV<\/a> and on-line\/CD-ROM versions of the classic Intellivision video games.\n____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: \"Skel\" (Derek McDonald)<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1205\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The <b>Bosman 8<\/b>, was made by \"G.Z.E. Unimor\" (Gdanskie Zaklady Elektroniczne Unimor) in Poland (Gdansk to be precise). It was released in 1987 as a system for schools and offices, but even CAD\/CAM software was developed for this machine and later, as being too expensive (cost 1 300 000 zl) and extremely hard to get (apparently only 1000 models have been produced), Bosman 8 was used mainly as a terminal for automatized processes (designing printed boards).\nThe main particularity of the Bosman 8 is that what you think is only an external disk drive is in fact the computer itself! Yes, everything is in this small box. But it needs to be connected to a terminal and a monitor. Two keyboard\/terminals were available: AN-2001 and ANG-3001, the latter featuring graphic possibilities. Indeed, the Bosman 8 seems to let the terminal manage all the display, hence different display features according to what \"keyboard\" terminal you are using... In fact it looks like the Bosman 8 was conceived as a system to turn an already existing terminal into a real computer.\nThe main unit was powered by a Z80A processor running at 4MHz, and has 16 KB of ROM. Another original feature is the amount of memory available. The User Manual claims to offer 512 KB of RAM (60KB operating memory and a 416KB on disk, which doesn't even make the count). In fact it seems that the Bosman 8 has 64 KB RAM (60 KB free for user?) and then can use 7 more 60 KB banks stored on disk, through a bank switching technique. Clever and quite original...\nTwo 3\"1\/2 or one 5\"1\/4 (200 KB?) floppy drives were built-in the system (max disk size was 800 KB - DS DD according to the manual). The monitor shipped with the Bosman 8 was a monochrome Neptun 159. There were also two more types of 12 ''monochrome monitors developed for it - an \"M4902\" and a \"M4801\" that was capable of working with a CGA or Hercules type display. \nThe whole system was apparently available in two colour versions: a bright gray model and dark gray model, but the differences are unclear (anyone can help?).\nIt run on a CPM\/R operating system and the manual says it's compatible with CP\/M\n2.2. \n___________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Tomasz Droszcz (info &amp; picture)<\/font>",

This was shortly after they announced their intention to produce its successor, the TI-99\/8, a computer with the \"big brother\" to the 4A's TMS9900 processor, the TMS9995.\nMyarc was a company that made a name for itself selling expansion cards for the TI's Peripheral Expansion Box, including memory, RS232, and disk controller cards.  They also produced a \"replacement\" for the large PE Box in a smaller self-contained unit.  Then, Myarc dropped the bombshell that they were producing an \"upgrade\" computer.  The unnamed machine - actually just a mock-up in a shell very similar to the 99\/8, was shown at the large, annual Chicago TI Faire.\n \nAfter a few years of false starts and production delays, the Myarc Geneve 9640 Family Computer was for sale.  The TI PE Box attached to the 4A via an interface card and large \"firehose\" cable.  The Geneve replaced this card, its cable, and the TI console itself - a \"computer on a card.\"  It featured the faster processor meant for the 99\/8, 80-column high-res graphics (composite and RGB interfaces were included), the ability to run almost all 4A software (including cartridges saved to a disk format), mouse and joystick interfaces, an IBM-style keyboard, and an Operating System somewhat similar to DOS.\nThe system shipped with mostly incomplete software, and this ultimately led to the demise of Myarc and the machine itself.  Today, Genve's can be found but are fairly rare.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Andy Frueh and the TI community<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1208\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

But even the liquidator had troubles selling the remaining stock of consoles and game cartridges.\nAfter much of the inventory had been sold, former Mattel marketing executive Terry Valeski with an investment group bought all rights to the Intellivision for $6.5 Million US in March of 1984, and started a new venture. The new company, INTV Corp., continued to sell old stock via retail and mail order.\nBy October of 1985 the old stock of Intellivision II consoles had ran out so they introduced a new console dubbed INTV III (later renamed ?Super Pro System?). This unit was actually a cosmetic rebadge of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">original Intellivision console<\/a> and was 100% compatible to it.\nIn addition to manufacturing new consoles, INTV Corp. also continued to develop new games, releasing a few new titles each year. Eventually, the system was discontinued in 1991 with the realization that competing video game technology had finally caught up to the Intellivision design.\nNOTE: The INTVIII should not be confused with ?Intellivision III?, an upgrade to the Intellivision II that was cancelled by Mattel in favor of the unfinished ?Intellivision IV? featuring a 68000 CPU (same as Amiga and Macintosh computers) with higher graphics to compete with ColecoVision.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: \"Skel\" (Derek McDonald)<\/font>",

        "description": "The Tandy 1000 was a line of <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a> compatible computers made during the 1980?s by the American Tandy Corporation for sale in their chain of Radio Shack electronics stores in Canada and the USA. The Tandy 1000 would be the successor to their influential <a href=\"computer.asp?c=409\">TRS-80<\/a> line of computers, the Tandy 1000 would eventually replace the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=91\">COCO<\/a> line of 8 bit computers as well when Tandy decided to prematurely end that project in favor of the Tandy PC line of computers.\nTargeted toward the home user with a modest budget, it copyied the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=186\">IBM PCjr<\/a>'s 16-color graphics (PCjr's graphics were an extension of CGA video) and anhanced 3-voice sound, but didn't use the PCjr cartridge ports, instead the Tandy version had built-in game ports compatible with those on the TRS-80 Color Computer (COCO), as well as a port for a \"light wand\/pen\". Most Tandy 1000 models also featured ?line-level? sound and composite video RCA outputs built onto the motherboard so that a standard television could be used as a monitor, albeit with much poorer video quality. Unlike most PC clones, early Tandy 1000 computers had MS-DOS built into ROM allowing the OS to boot in a few seconds. Tandy also bundled onto floppy diskette ?DeskMate?, a suite of consumer-oriented applications, with several models. Besides a composite output to TV, as mentioned earlier, Tandy 1000?s also housed a built in CGA video adaptor equal to PC standards built onto the motherboard and since the Tandy 1000 outlasted the PCjr by many years these graphics and sound standards became known as \"Tandy-compatible\" or \"TGA,\" and many software packages of the era listed their adherence to Tandy standards on the package. One odd feature of the Tandy-1000, however, was a non standard edge card printer connector built onto the motherboard and protruding through the rear; an adaptor would be needed to work a standard IBM style printer.\nIn 1984, when the ?T-1000? was in its prime, you may have paid up to $2499.00 (Canadian) for a full featured system with matching monitor.\nThe original line was equipped with the Intel-8088 CPU at 4.77Mhz, which was later extended to faster clock speeds up to 7.16Mhz, as well as the upgrade to 8086 and 80286 processors at 10Mhz (in the TL &amp; TX configurations). Common models of the machine included the Tandy 1000, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1213\">EX<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1211\">HX<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1215\">SX<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1216\">TX<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1218\">SL<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1218\">SL\/2<\/a>, RL, and TL, TL\/2, TL\/3.\nThe ?T-1000? was a workhorse in the IBM PC world, large numbers of units are still in active service today as it?s construction was quite robust. The T-1000 was Tandy?s last attempt in the home computer market. In the early 1990?s Tandy Corporation sold its computer manufacturing business to ?AST Computers?. When that occurred, instead of selling Tandy computers, Radio Shack stores began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as ?Compaq?.\nThe original Tandy 1000 was similar in size to the IBM PC except it had a plastic case to reduce weight. The original Tandy 1000 featured a proprietary serial keyboard port along with 2 similar joystick ports on the FRONT of the case (a feature that would become standard in later models). The rear featured a PC standard monitor connector (compatible with CGA\/EGA), a composite (TV) video-out connector, a single RCA-style monophonic line-level audio connector, a port for a light pen, and the unusual edge-card connector used to attach a parallel printer.\nThe original Tandy 1000 came standard with one 5.25 disk drive, with an additional bay usable for the installation of a second 5.25 disk drive (available as a kit from Radio Shack). 128k of memory was standard, with the computer accepting up to 640k of total memory with the addition of expansion cards. MS-DOS 2.11 and DeskMate 1.0 were included with the system.\nThe Tandy 1000 offered 256 characters: 96 standard ASCII characters, 48 block graphics characters, 64 foreign language\/Greek characters, 16 special graphics characters, 32 word processing\/scientific-notation characters.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Derek McDonald (aka ?Skel?)\nSources: Switchtec's Virtual PC Museum, Emperor Multimedia Electronic Archives, Wikipedia, 8-Bit Micro, Tandy 1000 PC Museum<\/font>",

        "description": "The Tandy 1000 HX is a member of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1210\">Tandy 1000 series<\/a> family. See this entry for more info.\nThe Tandy 1000 HX, released in 1987, was designed as another entry level <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM compatible personal computer<\/a> and the successor to the EX. Like the EX, the HX was a compact computer with the keyboard built into the computer casing. The computer came with an Intel 8088 CPU, 256 KB of memory, and had one 720 KB 3.5\" disk drive on the right side of the machine behind the keyboard.\nHX computers came with MS-DOS 2.11 built into the ROM and ?Deskmate 2? on diskette.\nThe computer's memory could be expanded to 640 KB by the use of a memory expansion card; by default these cards, sold by Tandy, came with 128 KB, but one could add another 384 KB in memory chips to this board. These cards were named ?Plus Cards? and used a pin configuration instead of the slot system used by IBM or the T-1000. The cards themselves followed all the IBM standards and eventually Radio Shack started selling the adaptors in their stores to allow the cards to be inserted into a standard IBM 8-bit ISA slot. There were three such spots available in the computer case.\nThere was also a spare 3.5\" drive bay in the computer case. On the back of the machine there was a port which allowed a user to connect an external 5.25\" (360 KB) or 3.5\" (720 KB) disk drive. There was also a connector for a printer.\nThe 1000 HX did not come with a hard drive, and Tandy Corporation did not manufacture fixed disks for this type of computer. A HDD could be purchased from third party vendors, however.\nIt was also here that the DOS in ROM was getting a little old and for the first time the settings on the computer could be changed so that instead of looking in ROM for DOS at bootup, it would go direct to the floppy drive instead. Most versions of MS-DOS worked with the 1000 HX, including 3.x, DOS 5.x &amp; 6.x. DOS 4.0 did not work due to a bug in its environment that prevented it from working.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Derek McDonald (aka ?Skel?)\nSources: Switchtec's Virtual PC Museum, Emperor Multimedia Electronic Archives, Wikipedia, 8-Bit Micro, Tandy 1000 PC Museum<\/font>",

These cartridges would only work on the TutorVision model and not on a regular Intellivision unit, although the TutorVision would also be able to play regular Intellivision cartridges also. The World Book direct sales staff would market Tutorvision as they did encyclopedias; i.e.: get the console and one set of the cartridges for a set of monthly payments.\n____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: \"Skel\" (Derek McDonald)<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1214\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

It was possible to add a second disk drive or even a hard disk.\nThe SL series offered two innovations over the earlier SX series. One is high resolution (640x200) 16 color graphics; the other is an improved sound circuit, using an 8-bit mono DAC alongside the PSSJ 3-voice sound source. The DAC gave the SL series digital sound output capabilities not much unlike those of the early 8-bit SoundBlaster line of audio cards: 3 PCM voices, 8-bit DMA up to 22050 KHz, audio mono output, audio mono inputs (mic + line), sampling at 5512 KHz, 11025 KHz and 22050 KHz.\nOne interesting feature was the 512 KB BIOS, from which 350 KB where available as a read-only C: drive. DOS 3.3 and the main component of Deskmate 3 where stored on it. This was excellent as you could access DOS and start to work only within a few seconds (an unreachable dream nowadays).\nThere is no internal clock but one called \"SmartWatch\" was available as an option. There was thus a socket on the electronic board reserved for it.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Derek McDonald (aka ?Skel?)\nSources: Wikipedia, MO5.com<\/font>\n<b>Ray Jewhurst<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The SL and SL\/2 both came with Deskmate 3 not Deskmate 2 I know this because I used to be a Radio Shack store manager in the early 90's and Deskmate 3 was one of improvement over the SX.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Tandy 2000 was launched in December 1981, a full year BEFORE the 1000, and proved to be a mistake on the part of Tandy, but to their credit they weren?t alone, many manufacturers who built systems based on the Intel 80186 CPU suffered the same fate.\nOn the surface the computer was quite the catch:\nThe ?T-2000? featured new instructions and new fault tolerance protection over the TRS-80 and COCO lines. Tandy built the 2000 with advanced color graphics, Intel 16bit processing at 8 Mhz and 2 720K 5.25? Floppy disks; and a CPU that was out performing even the 80286 computers of the time! It was a robust computer with excellent features but that 80186 CPU would come back to haunt it. The Tandy 2000 by many was considered the first AT style computer in North America, a bold and risky move by Tandy.\nDespite all the advancements, the 80186 CPU was not popular with software developers, so few wrote software for the 80186. More to the point, however, the Tandy 2000, while touted as being compatible with the IBM XT, was different enough for most software beyond purely text oriented to not work properly. It differed by having a Tandy-specific video mode (640x400, not related to or forward-compatible with VGA), along with the new concept of keyboard scan codes, and the proprietary 720kb 5-1\/4\" floppy format: no other computer used this disk format, which was single-sided high-density, using standard 1.2Mb double-sided high-density disks; the drives could read and write 360kb floppies, but be careful when doing so if the disks were to be subsequently used in an IBM-compatible; there were hardware hacks to use 720kb 3.5\" floppy drives, but it was unclear whether disks formatted in this way were compatible with standard PC-compatibles.\nIn addition: The Tandy 2000 was nominally BIOS-compatible with the IBM XT, which allowed extremely well-behaved DOS software to run on both platforms. However, most DOS software is not so well behaved and many PC programmers would bypass the PC-BIOS to achieve higher performance, rendering the software incompatible with the Tandy 2000. Microsoft provided a special version of MS-DOS that could combat these problems, but it was a proprietary programming venture. All other units, including the later Tandy 1000, operated on what was essentially the standard PC-DOS (IBMs version) or MS-DOS.  The Tandy 2000 was further killed by the arrival of the 80286 CPU 2 months after its release.\nIn fairness, Tandy wasn't the only casualty of the 80186. Other computers that were built on that format, mostly from Europe, such as the Compis and the Dulmont Magnum were marketed with the CP\/M operating system suffered the same fate. If you had a machine based on those systems the only thing that could realistically run on them was the CP\/M operating system, but software was scarce, at least with MS-DOS you had some options with software.\nIn the end the computer was poorly supported by Radio Shack; eventually the remaining unsold computers were converted into the first Radio Shack Terminals (which, oddly enough, had been one of the original backup plans for the original TRS-80 Model 1). The Tandy 2000 computer was the only computer sold by Radio Shack that had both logos on the case \"Tandy\" and \"TRS-80\". The Tandy 2000 computer was the first to have the \"Tandy\" logo on it.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Derek McDonald (aka ?Skel?)\nSources: Switchtec's Virtual PC Museum, Emperor Multimedia Electronic Archives, Wikipedia, 8-Bit Micro, Tandy 1000 PC Museum<\/font>",

Things must be seen differently. Philips \/ Signetics developped a hardware platform to demonstrate the possibilities of their Signetics 2650 &amp; 2636 chipsets. Somehow, this hardware was licenced (by Philips?) to many third-companies around the world resulting in systems like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1189\">Voltmace DataBase<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=906\">Acetronic MPU-1000<\/a>, ITMC MPT-05, etc.\nSome times later, the hardware was improved, with the use of a Signetics 2637 instead of the 2636 (handling the audio &amp; video), somehow resulting in a new wave of licenced systems, all based on the same hardware and playing the same games.

        "description": "In the early '90s Atari was approached by a company called Flair Technology. They claimed that they could design a new console that would be better than the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">SNES<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Mega Drive<\/a>. Atari were so impressed that they provided funding for a new company called Flair II. The newly formed company set about designing two new machines, the 32 bit Panther and the 64 bit Jaguar. After cancelling the Panther project, Atari contracted IBM to manufacture the Jaguar.\nReleased late in 1993, the Jaguar was marketed as the worlds first 64 bit console resulting in speculation as to whether really was. Containing five processors on three chips, only two of them were in fact 64 bit. A proprietary chip named TOM contained two 64 bit and one 32 bit processors. Primarily used for graphics processing TOM was also able to execute program code if desired. JERRY was another 32 bit proprietary chip responsible for sound processing while a 16 bit Motorola 68000 acted as a main controller, managing the other two chips and executing code. \nIncluded with the Jaguar was one of the largest joypads ever made, with an 8-way d-pad, A, B and C buttons, pause and option buttons, and a 12 key numeric pad complete with star and hash keys! It also shipped with a free game, Cybermorph, which included a plastic overlay for the controller's number pad for a customised control layout.\nThe Jaguar's short lifespan came to an end when Atari merged with JTS in 1996. With sales of around just 150,000 units and poor publisher support, production ended soon after. This would be Atari's final machine (the Jaguar II was planned but never released), and a sad end to the company that once dominated the console market. Atari is now controlled by French company Infogrames, where it continues as a software publisher. \n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>",

This allowed arcade perfect games as the cartridge contained both the arcade and home version of a game, an EPROM on the motherboard selecting which version to use. Only a slightly different cartridge slot prevented MVS cartridges from working in the AES and vice versa.\nThe Neo Geo's arcade origins were evident in its controllers. Arcade style joysticks and buttons set in a rather large (11.5\" x 8\") base meant they were best suited for table top use rather than with your feet up on the sofa.\nOriginally only released for rental in the United States, SNK made the console available for sale when it became apparent that people were willing to spend money on a home arcade machine. Despite its high price tag, the machine sold over a million units, with well over one hundred games released, costing from $200 each.\nWith support for the machine officially ended in 2004, the Neo Geo has one of longest lifespans in console history, second only to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=878\">Atari 2600<\/a>. Independent games were still being released in 2006, proving the consoles long term appeal with fans.\n_____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>",

        "description": "Nintendo's follow up to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=866\">NES<\/a> arrived in 1990. Bundled with the classic Super Mario World the console proved to be very popular, but never had the same level of success in the States as the NES did. In fact, the SNES could only manage second place in the 16 bit era until the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Genesis<\/a> was discontinued. A similar situation occurred in Europe, where the SNES was competing with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1247\">Mega Drive<\/a>. Despite this, combined sales for the SNES\/Super Famicom eventually reached almost 50 million units world-wide.\nThe casing of the console came in two different versions. The American version of the SNES is pictured on the right, and at the time was described as looking like \"a large breeze block\", while the European version shared the sleeker design of the Japanese <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1248\">Super Famicom<\/a>. The cartridges echoed the console's designs, American cartridges being more square than their rounded Japanese and European counterparts.\nWith around 750 games released in the United States and Europe, and many more Japanese only titles, owners certainly had plenty of choice. One of the biggest sales boosts came from a near arcade perfect version of Street Fighter II, released at the peak of the games popularity.\nAround the time of the Mega CD, Nintendo planned a CD-ROM add-on with the aid of Phillips and Sony. Artists impressions were published in magazines but the device was never manufactured. Phillips went on to create the CD-i while Sony's efforts would result in the PlayStation.\nA number of peripherals were released, most notably 1994's Super Game Boy. This allowed the use of the wide selection of Game Boy games, which could be displayed with colour borders. The games themselves could also be displayed in colour, and a number of four colour palettes were available to select from.\nBy 1996 a new generation of consoles had begun. In an attempt to prolong the console's life, Nintendo of America launched a redesigned <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1249\">SNES 2<\/a> in 1997, similar to what had previously been done with the NES 2.\n_____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>",

        "description": "The Otrona Attache was the most wanted transportable computer at the time as it was the smallest of its category. Preceded by the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=181\">Osborne<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=550\">Kaypro II<\/a>, the Attache was also more expensive than its competitors. Compactness has a price!\nThe Attache is this a nice little CP\/M system. High-resolution graphics, compact keyboard, 64 KB RAM, real time battery-packed clock, composite video output, delivered with Wordstar, MBasic, CP\/M, the Otrona Attache had all that was needed at the time to be efficient.\nin 1983, Otrona released a second model, the <b>Attache 8:16<\/b> which was in fact a \"normal\" Attache with an Intel 8086 expansion board built-in, thus offering the MS-DOS world in addition to the CP\/M compatibility. The <a href=\"computer.asp?c=274\">IBM PC<\/a> was already putting a strong pressure on the market. The rush toward MS-DOS compatibility had begun, announcing CP\/M death. Meanwhile, hybrid machines like this one appeared on the market illustrating the transition.\nIn May 1984, Otrona announced a new transportable model, the <b>Otrona 2001<\/b>, using an Intel 8088 processor. Sadly the 2001 wasn't completely IBM PC compatible and the production costs were high. Like its predecessor (Attache), the 2001 had real assets, but was too expensive compared to other portables. As Otrona didn't want to exceed the $3000 price limit to stay competitive against IBM and Compaq, they had to throw in the towel.\nToo bad, as the demand for the \"2001\" ran extraordinarily well, as Otrona president Jim Lindner explained. 1000 orders in the month were common.\nBut in september 1984, Otrona Advanced Systems announced that it was ceasing production.  It gave notice to its 175 employees and said that it had decided that is was not able to reorganize (and thus continue in business) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. Jim Lindner hoped for a buyback which never came (?).",

        "description": "After Sony and Nintendo's collaboration on the Super CD-ROM came to an end, Sony continued their research and decided to make a stand alone console. A deal was reached with Nintendo to allow the Play Station (as it was called then) to play <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">SNES<\/a> cartridges. This feature was dropped from the final design, and the name changed to PlayStation.\nA powerful machine, the PlayStation featured 3D graphics capabilities which at the time were remarkable. Games like Tomb Raider made 3D game worlds popular and effectively put an end to the 2D shoot 'em ups and platformers which had been around since the late '70s and early '80s. \nEarly units suffered from problems with the laser mechanism. The CD tray was made from plastic and over a period of time would wear away resulting in games no longer working. A common solution was to turn the console on its side or even upside down to relieve stress on the laser's motor. Later units had a metal tray to prevent this problem. \nEven to this day the PlayStation is often wrongly referred to as the PSX, the correct term being PS. PSX was the name given to the PlayStation based arcade hardware and later a Japanese only version of the PS2, which was capable of digital video recording and featured either a 160 GB or 250 GB hard drive.\n \nA redesigned machine named <b>PSone<\/b> was released in 2000. This smaller version lacked the serial port but was otherwise fully compatible with older games. The PS and PSone achieved combined sales of more than 102 million units between them, making the PlayStation the first ever console to break the 100 million mark. In the process PlayStation became a household name, ended Nintendo's domination of the market and fought off competition from Sega's <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1236\">Saturn<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1246\">Dreamcast<\/a>, which no doubt had an influence on Sega's decision to pull out of the console hardware business.\n______________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>",

Selling well from launch, the PS2 was another success for Sony. Strong third party support and backwards compatability ensured a wide variety of games.\nAfter release users reported a variety of problems including DVD playback and the infamous laser problem, where the machine was unable to read blue discs. This problem was so widespread that in America a class action lawsuit was filed against Sony. \n2003 saw the Japanese only release of the PSX which was capable of recording video on DVD-R discs and featured either a 160 GB or 250 GB hard drive. The PSX was visually very different from the PS2. A smoother white case that looked somewhat like a VCR replaced the grooved black case of the PS2. The PSX also had an updated user interface, similar to that of the PSP. \nIn 2004 a slimline version of the PS2 was released, not without its own problems. Because of the smaller case an external power supply was used, a number of which were recalled due to the possibility of overheating. The slimline version also featured an Ethernet port and integrated modem. \nDespite these problems the PS2 was extremely popular, selling more than 115 million units world-wide to date according to Sony. It has been suggested this is an artificially high figure though, as some users report having owned as many as four or more replacement machines due to the problems with the laser.\n______________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>",

        "description": "Designed by software company Hudson Soft (Famed for the Bomberman series), financial backing was needed to put the console into production. At the same time NEC was looking for a way into the console market. \nGames for the PC Engine came on credit card sized HuCards, similar to the cards that could be used on the original <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=840\">Master System<\/a>.\nOutselling the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=866\">Famicom<\/a> in Japan, the PC Engine went on to be a worthy competitor to the 16 bit <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Mega Drive<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">Super Famicom<\/a>, despite being an 8 bit system. The custom chips meant it was still a powerful machine and the graphics were remarkable for the time. PC-Engine games have a distinct style, featuring large, colourful sprites, which still hold up well today. \nA CD add-on was released two years before the Mega CD, making the PC Engine the first console capable of playing CD games. The PC Engine CD-ROM? received its own upgrades in the Super System Card which increased RAM to 256 KB and later the Arcade Card Pro. This increased the RAM to 2 MB, and provided the best home versions of games like Ryuko No Ken (Art Of Fighting) and Garou Densetsu (Fatal Fury) outside of their native <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1225\">Neo Geo<\/a>.\n______________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>\n<b>Taneli Lukka<\/b> from Finland comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">The original PCE is perhaps one of the most beautiful consoles of all time and also the smallest original home console ever, only about twice the size of the standard controller. Today it is the most wanted standard PCE console for collectors and can be pretty hard to find in good condition because the white plastic easily yellows in sunlight and gets generally dirty.\nA problem when using the machine outside Japan is that it only has RF output which gives a poor quality picture and most TV's outside Japan can't understand the NTSC RF signal. NEC did release a peripheral called the AV-Booster which plugs into the back of the console and gives standard RCA composite and stereo sound output. The Interface Unit required by CD-Rom2 drive also has RCA connectors built in.\nAll of NEC's home consoles were designed to be used with RF or composite output only. S-Video and RGB signal were never originally included altough the machines video chip outputs RGB without problems. Many collectors machines have been RGB modified. The problem with the RGB mod is that many game designers counted on the a bit fuzzy RF and composite outputs to mix colors for them: by putting two diffirent colors side by side they could create a third color or some other effect. The result is that when when using a RGB modded console some games look grainy and the colors or some effects seem a bit off. I have noticed this myself with my RGB modded PCE and prefer the composite output with a number of games.<\/font>",

        "description": "Released in Japan and the United States towards the end of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Mega Drive<\/a>'s life, the Nomad was basically a handheld version of the popular home console.\nNo games were ever specifically created for the Nomad, limiting it to the back catalogue of the Mega Drive. Not that this was really a problem, as by this time there was already a significant number games available. However, due to the power requirements of the Mega Drive hardware and the backlit 3.25\" LCD screen, the Nomad suffered the same short battery life which had plagued Sega's earlier <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1109\">Game Gear<\/a>. Depending on the game being played, the Nomad could drain its six batteries in just 90 minutes!\nA novel feature for a handheld was the inclusion of AV out connectors and a controller port. This meant the Nomad could be connected to a TV set and allowed for simultaneous two player gameplay. \nWith little marketing support from Sega and the arrival of the 32 bit era, prices were quickly slashed to as little as $60 to offload excess stock. The rarity of the Nomad (less than 1 million were sold) has made it something of a collectors item, and in the U.K., where the machine is largely unheard of, boxed examples can fetch anything up to ?150.\n_____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: Ste (text &amp; info)<\/font>",

        "description": "Rumoured to be a follow up to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1231\">PC Engine<\/a>, the Super Grafx turned out to be merely an update. It was released without any warning by NEC and never found a place in the marketplace because earlier PCE consoles were still being manufactured at the same time.\nDespite having four times the RAM, it featured the same 8 bit processor and sound capabilities as the PC Engine, although it now had an extra GPU. Having two GPUs meant the Super Grafx could display two background layers and allowed more depth and colour, but they were limited by the processor and didn't really give the system much of a performance boost.\nThe console didn't sell well and games were expensive at around $110. Only six games were specifically released for the Super Grafx, the most notable being Capcom's 1941 which is not available for any other console, and today reaches very high prices, especially when in complete condition, as it had a rather fragile cardboard box that easily gets ruined. \nFortunately the Super Grafx was compatible with all the PC Engine's HuCard and CD games. In fact, it is the only machine that can play all the games released for the PCE series of consoles. Although it was designed to be used with the newer Super CD-ROM? drive, which was released at around the same time, it can also be used with the old CD-ROM? drive by using the RAU-30 adapter.\n________________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Text co-written by *_Ste_* and Taneli Lukka<\/font>",

        "description": "The picture shows a computer called the WITCH which stood for Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computing from Harwell. It was built at AERE Harwell in 1948 and was won by the then Wolverhampton and South Staffordshire Technical College in a national competition in 1957. The photograph above was taken in 1961. \nThe technology consisted of mixture of 1940's vintage telephone exchange technology (GPO 3000 type relays) and early nuclear instrumentation (Dekatron tubes).\nA Dekatron tube was a device rather similar to a neon indicator light except that it had 10 anodes rather than one. By carefully timed and shaped steering pulses on intermediate electrodes the active glow could be moved from one anode to another. Dekatrons were used for event counting in early nuclear instrumentation before the advent of solid state electronics. In the WITCH the Dekatrons were used for storing digits of numbers. A row of 10 dekatrons could store a single number. \nThe WITCH was a very slow computer by modern standards. It took it \n- 2 seconds to add or subtract 2 numbers \n- 5 seconds to multiply two numbers \n- 15 seconds to divide two numbers. (Division by zero took rather longer.) \nThe fully developed configuration at Wolverhampton had 90 memory locations. Programs were read from a paper tape reader in an adjacent room. \nThere were actually 6 electromechanical paper tape readers, the current one being selectable under program control. Whenever the WITCH had finished executing an instruction it read the next instruction from the current paper tape reader. Program loops were constructed with the aid of a pot of glue. \nOne unfortunate problem with paper tape loops was the tendency of the mechanical readers to poke extra holes in the paper tape after several passes. If your job was sufficiently important you could use special linen tape which was more resistant to this effect. \nIt was possible to determine the contents of any memory location by simply examining the relevant row of Dekatrons. The storage locations were in the two racks visible on the left hand side of the picture. The central rack of electronics contained the arithmetic and control units. It was possible to watch the multiplication of two numbers by seeing the partial products building up in the accumulator (another row of Dekatrons). \nThe WITCH was used for many years for introductory and schools' courses. In its later years it became increasingly unreliable and spares become difficult to obtain. Eventually, in the mid 1970s, it was retired to the Birmingham's Museum Collections Centre, where it is still on display. \n______________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Credits: Peter Burden &amp; University of Wolverhampton<\/font>",

        "description": "After spending two years developing the successor to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Mega Drive\/Genesis<\/a>, Sega launched the Saturn in November 1994.\nThe console had two CPUs, two GPUs, and a number of other processors which made it difficult to program for and the quality of the software programming varied considerably. A number of games used only one CPU in order to simplify the task, others made full use of the Saturns power. For example, Virtua Fighter 2 used a different CPU for each character during a fight. However, the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1229\">PlayStation<\/a>'s far higher sales figures and simpler architecture lead to developers favouring Sony's machine and the Saturn received less than a third of the games that the PS enjoyed\nOutside of Japan the first overseas models got a redesigned controller (MK-80100). Most people agreed that this was the worst controller that Sega had ever sold their customers. Not only was the d-pad quite inaccurate but the L+R triggers were also difficult to use, often requiring them to be pressed down from the top edge rather than pulled towards the user. Eventually, a version of the original Japanese controller (MK-80116) made it's way overseas for later models of the console.\nAlthough quite successful in Japan the Saturn was far less popular in the U.S. and Europe, finishing the fifth generation race behind both the PlayStation and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1242\">Nintendo 64<\/a>. Sega discontinued the Saturn in 1998 hoping to get a head start in the next gen battle with their new contender, the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1246\">Dreamcast<\/a>.\nThere were a number of variations of the console during its lifespan, a brief summary of the differences follows:\nJapan\nSega Saturn (HST-0001\/HST-3200): First Japanese model. Has a grey case, black cartridge flap, blue oval buttons and a drive access light. Early models use BIOS revision 1.00, later models use revision 1.01. Comes with a black controller which has a coloured bottom row of buttons, a red start button and red L+R buttons.\nSega Saturn (unknown): Second Japanese model. Almost white case, same colour as the Dreamcast but with a grey cartridge flap. During production the buttons changed colour from purple to grey and also changed shape from oval to round. Uses the 1.01 BIOS. Comes with a light grey controller with a coloured bottom row of buttons and red L+R buttons.\nSega Skeleton Saturn (HST-3220): Limited edition of around 50,000 consoles. Has a translucent grey case and controller, round black buttons and a pink CD door button. CD door has \"This Is Cool\" written on it. Uses the 1.01 BIOS. Has compatibility problems with some software.\nSega Derby Saturn (unknown): Limited edition produced to promote the game Derby Stallion. Has a translucent greenish blue case, round black buttons and a pink CD door button. Comes with the same controller as the Skeleton Saturn. Uses the 1.01 BIOS. Has compatibility problems with some software.\nU.S.A.\nSega Saturn (MK-80000): First U.S. model. Has a black case, oval buttons and a drive access light. Early models use BIOS revision 1.00a, later models use revision 1.01a.\nSega Saturn (MK-80000A): Second U.S. model. Has a black case, round buttons and no drive access light. Uses the 1.01a BIOS.\nSega Saturn (MK-80001): Third U.S. model. Has a black case, round buttons and no drive acces light. Slightly modified motherboard layout. Uses the 1.01a BIOS.\nEurope\nSega Saturn (MK-80200-50): First European model. Has a black case, black oval buttons and a drive access light. Early models use BIOS revision 1.00a, later models use revision 1.01a.\nSega Saturn (MK-80200A-50: Second European model. Has a black case, round grey buttons and no drive access light. Uses the 1.01a BIOS.",

It is similar to the Multi-Mega, being a combination of a <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Mega Drive<\/a> and Mega CD, but with the added ability to function as a karaoke machine and improved sound thanks to JVC's new DSP. The system shipped with four karaoke programs and a compilation CD of four games. Two microphones can be connected to the system so users can sing along with CDs, or, thanks to a button on the machine, the CDs vocals can be muted allowing you to sing with just the music as a backing track.\nIn 1993 the WonderMIDI package was released. This allowed users to connect a MIDI keyboard the Wondermega to create sound effects and music, and included instructional software which could help people learn to play the piano. 1993 also saw a re-release of the system, with several small changes designed to reduce cost.",

The 16 attached to the end of the name referred to the fact it had 16 bit graphics. While the system itself was only 8 bit, the custom chips meant it was still a powerful machine and the graphics were remarkable for the time.\nA CD add-on was released two years before the Mega CD, making the PC Engine\/TurboGrafx-16 the first console capable of playing CD games. The TurboGrafx-CD received its own upgrade in the Super System Card which increased Ram to 256 KB. The Arcade Card Pro was never released outside of Japan.\nThe machine received a limited release in Europe, where it was known simply as the Turbografx. Very few details are available about the European version but it has been suggested that no games were ever released, leaving users with just the one game that came with the console.",

        "description": "Atari's first (and only) handheld console was released in 1989. Unfortunately for Atari though, Nintendo had recently released their all conquering Game Boy. Despite being technologically superior, the Lynx just couldn't compete.\nOriginally developed by software publisher Epyx and named Handy (which is also the name of one of the machines best emulators), financial difficulties meant a development partner was needed. A deal was agreed which would see Atari manufacture and market the machine while Epyx handled software development.\nThe Lynx was far more powerful than the Game Boy, using custom chips and benefiting from a 3.5\" colour screen. It also had a duplicate set of buttons and the ability to flip the screen which meant it could be used left handed. However, the better specs meant that the Lynx could drain its batteries in just 4 hours! Sales were steady, but nothing like those of the cheaper Game Boy.\nIn 1991 a redesigned Lynx II arrived, featuring a backlit screen and stereo sound output. Battery life improved 25% to around 5 hours and a price drop to $99 helped sales but by this time the Lynx was already a long way behind. With Atari's popularity on the slide and the release of Sega's <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1109\">Game Gear<\/a> in America and Europe the same year, which received numerous games already popular on Sega's home consoles, the Lynx was relegated to a distant third in the handheld battle.",

        "description": "Originally starting life as \"Project Reality\" the Nintendo 64 was the follow up to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">SNES<\/a>. The press went wild over the new console, with articles claiming it could generate graphics on a par with high end Silicon Graphics workstations.\nTwo arcade games (Cruis'n USA and Killer Instinct) were made in 1994 to show the public what the Ultra 64, as it was now known, would be capable of. The announcement on the Killer Instinct intro \"available for your home in 1995, own a Nintendo Ultra 64!\" may have seemed like good publicity, but was a bit misleading. The N64 wasn't released until 1996, and the change of name to Nintendo 64 meant nobody could buy an Ultra 64 even if they wanted one. To make matters worse, both games used different hardware, not only from that of the N64 but each other as well!\nBy the time the N64 launched it could only ever be a victim of its own hype. The CD-ROM was rapidly becoming the favoured format for consoles, mainly due to the increased storage space and lower production costs, and Nintendo's decision to stick with cartridges would prove costly. The limited storage size of cartridges, coupled with a tiny 4 KB limit on texture size, meant the N64 could never live up to the stunning rendered images that had been printed in the press.\nThe machine received a number of great games, most notably GoldenEye and the classic launch title Super Mario 64, but this simply wasn't enough. Third party publishers abandoned the N64 in favour of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1229\">PlayStation<\/a> and the releases started to dry up, with very few games being released towards the end of the console's lifespan.\nIn December 1999 the 64DD was released in Japan. First announced in 1995, before the N64 was even launched, most people were expecting a CD based add-on. Instead it used magnetic disks, similar to those used in Zip drives. Although the disks were cheaper to produce they had the same 64 MB maximum size as the cartridges, rendering the whole idea somewhat pointless. Like most console add-ons of this type, the 64DD was largely considered to be a failure. Only nine pieces of software were ever released for the 64DD and the machine's world-wide launch was cancelled.",

(TTI), which consisted of ex-employees from both NEC and Hudson Soft, after the apparent failings of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1240\">TurboGrafx-16<\/a> campaign.\nThe console contained a TG-16 and the newer Super CD-ROM? unit which were unified in a single case, along with the Super System Card integrated on the motherboard and buyers received quite a package for their money. A control pad, TG-CD versions of Ys book I &amp; II, a compilation of four Super CD games and a TurboChip game were all included in the $299 price tag. There was no escaping the fact that this was still a system based on ageing 8 bit technology though.\nWhen Sega's Mega CD launched the same year and promptly outsold the TurboDuo, a series of four mini comic book adverts were launched. Featuring Johnny Turbo, a superhero who battles the evil Feka's attempts to sell CD add-ons for their system (which NEC had already done themselves with the TG-CD) and reveals Feka staff to be robots. Despite being quite entertaining and well drawn, the adverts appear to be little more than a bizarre attack on Sega's ethics rather than a genuine attempt to sell the TurboDuo.\nNEC stopped officially supporting the TurboDuo in 1995, and withdrew from America to concentrate their efforts on their native Japan and the newly released <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=796\">PC-FX<\/a>.",

The original PCE, Core I, Core II and two diffirent CD-Rom drives seem to have been manufactured side by side. New models never really replaced the old ones but merely supplanted them. NEC didn't even keep proper records of their console output or lost them somewhere along the way.

        "description": "The Dreamcast, as it would come to be known, was the result of two competing development projects. Two teams, one from Japan and one from America, were tasked with creating a new console, mainly to get a head start in the next gen battle after the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1236\">Saturn<\/a>'s lack of success. \nThe machines were quite similar with both teams settling on the Hitachi SH-4 for the CPU, the main difference being the choice of manufacturer for the graphics chip. The Japanese team went for a chip based on VideoLogic's PowerVR technology. This machine was codenamed White Belt, Guppy, and Katana. 3dfx was the company of choice for the American team. Using technology based on the Voodoo 2 chip these prototypes were codenamed Black Belt, Shark and Dural. This project came to an end when 3dfx revealed details of their deal with Sega, which lead to the Japanese team being given the go ahead to develop what would become the Dreamcast.\nWhen the Dreamcast launched in 1998 it was by far the most powerful console available, as was demonstrated by Soul Calibur which featured stunning animation and could easily have been mistaken for a tech demo. Early sales were very strong, with the console breaking records for pre-orders and first day sales. However, Sony's announcement of the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1230\">PlayStation 2<\/a> in April 1999, almost a year before it launched, had a dramatic impact on sales. PlayStation had become a household name while Sega's image had been severely damaged by previous hardware such as the 32X and Mega CD. Sales slowed as both consumers and developers waited for the launch of the PS2.\nIn January 2001 Sega announced that Dreamcast production would cease by March that year. This would be the end of Sega's presence in the home console business, although the company would continue as a software publisher and an arcade machine developer.\nSoftware was still developed by a number of companies including Sega who released their final Dreamcast game, Puyo Pop Fever, in February 2004. Independent games continued to be developed, the most recent being released in March 2007.\nThe Dreamcast was pretty much developed around the Sega Model-3 arcade system board &amp; stuck into a console.  The Model 3 arcade system was more familiar as the arcade machine that run games such as Daytona USA &amp; Sega Rally in many amusement arcades in the mid 90's.  The Saturn was also based on an arcade system, known as the \"Titan\" or ST-V which was more familiar in arcades running familiar games such as Virtua Racing &amp; early versions of Virtua Fighter.  it is also rumoured the dreamcast used a 3dfx Voodoo 2 graphics system in early versions.\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1246\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

The practically unheard of TurboGrafx was extremely rare and the Mega Drive was able to outsell the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">SNES<\/a>, finishing the generation in first place. \nHowever, the success of the console in Europe, and as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=837\">Genesis<\/a> in the States, may well have contributed to Sega's downfall. Two misjudged add-ons, the 32X and Mega CD put a huge dent in Sega's reputation, one so large that the company would never recover. \nA redesigned <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=843\">Mega Drive II<\/a> was released in 1993. The smaller console was cheaper to produce, similar in concept to the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1252\">Master System II<\/a>.",

Between them the Super Famicom and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1226\">SNES<\/a> acheived combined sales of almost 50 million units world-wide.\nWith well over 750 games released, owners certainly had plenty of choice. One of the biggest sales boosts came from a near arcade perfect version of Street Fighter II, released at the peak of the games popularity.\nAround the time of the Mega CD, Nintendo planned a CD-ROM add-on with the aid of Phillips and Sony. Artists impressions were published in magazines but the device was never manufactured. Phillips went on to create the CD-i while Sony's efforts would result in the PlayStation.\nA number of peripherals were released, most notably 1994's Super Game Boy. This allowed the use of the wide selection of Game Boy games, which could be displayed with colour borders. The games themselves could also be displayed in colour, and a number of four colour palettes were available to select from.\n1995 saw the launch of the Satellaview, a modem which connected to the expansion port. Users were able to download games which were released in instalments.\nProduction of the Super Famicom eventually came to an end in 2003, after an incredible 13 years of official support.",

It was smaller and lighter than the original version, lacking the expansion and RF ports of the old model, although the internal hardware remained exactly the same. The decision to ship the SNES 2 with Super Mario World 2 was rather apt, as the original Super Mario World was part of the original SNES bundle. The SNES 2 was released in Japan as the Super Famicom 2. The only difference was the colouring and the cartridge slot.\nUltimately, the SNES was outclassed by the new 32 bit systems, and production was halted in 1999.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.silicium.org%20for\" target=\"_blank\">www.silicium.org<\/a> the picture<\/font>",

To cut production costs Sega removed the card slot which meant users could not play Sega Card games or use the 3D glasses. Also removed was the A\/V output and the reset button, along with the Expansion port.\nDespite the Master System II now being marketed by Sega, it was too late for the machine in America and the public simply weren't interested.

        "description": "The Microtutor, manufactured in 1976, was used to educate engineers and others on how to program microprocessors. The unit is fully self-contained with the exception of the 9-volt power converter which plugs into the back of the unit. A clear plexiglass bottom allows the user to see all of the soldering done on the underside of the main board. The chips are all labelled both on the chip and on the board itself.\nThere are three slots in the back labelled M,P,E. The M slot (M for Memory) allows the insertion of a card containing 256 bytes of memory. The P slot (P for Processor) allows the insertion of a processor card (here RCA CDP1801). The third slot labelled 'E' is for expansion and allows the user to create custom cards for controlling other devices.\nMicrotutor is an 8-bit computer whose heart is the RCA CDP1801 microprocessor. It's made up of two plug-in ICs; the control IC and the register IC, both of which are mounted on the same plug-in card. RCA also proposed a CDP1802 which could handle more instructions than the 1801, and is on a single chip, but the basics of the 1801 and 1802 are the same. The control chip of the 1801 receives control signals from the clock and in turn controls the movemement of instructions and data through the register chip and into the RAM. There are 256 memory locations available in Microtutor although an 1801 can address up to 65,536 locations.\nThere are four control switches and eight data switches. Let's look at the four control switches: Clear, Start, Load, and In. The Clear button returns the microprocessor to the first instruction of your program and lets it sit there. The Start button begins execution of the program. The Load toggle switch is turned up when the program steps are entered and down when the program is to be run. The In button is pressed once for each instruction or data wword to be loaded. An instruction or data word is selected with the 8 \"data\" switches (these are toggles) and then In is pressed. Each press of In causes the instruction or data word to be entered into the next available memory location in the RAM.

        "description": "Still sought after by writers and students, the Tandy WP-2 and Tandy WP-3 are perfect writing companions. Used to take notes, prepare reports and write letters, these WP systems are technically real computers based on a Zilog Z80 processor. The WP-2 is essentially a Tandy-branded version of a Citizen portable wordprocessor called the <b>CBM-10WP<\/b>.\nExtract from Tandy catalog:\n\"There are battery operated, weight only 3.1 pounds and are 1\" thin. The full size keyboard lets you cut, paste, search, replace, center and justify your text with just a few keystrokes. And there's no need to lug around a heavy dictionnary. The jet black case houses a 100,000-word spelling checker and a 200,000-word thesaurus. For hard copies of your work, the WP-2 easily connectes to Tandy or IBM-compatible printers. You even add an optional modem to transfer files to your personal computer by phone.\"\nThe following applications are built-in ROM and available in standard: TEXT, TELCOM, PHONE (address), CALENDAR (schedule), SPELLCHECK and FILES.\nThe WP-2\/3 while being dedicated word processors also have a terminal mode and x-modem file transfer capabilities. You can write programs on another computer, assemble them and xfer them to the WP-2\/3 with x-modem and they can then be run.\nThe <b>WP-3<\/b> seems to be the exact same model except that it has 64 KB as standard (whereas the WP-2 has 32 KB). The only other significant difference between the WP-2 and WP-3 is that the WP-3 has British English dictionary and the keyboard can generate the UK pound symbol.\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Contributors: David Wilson<\/font>",

Although a market test was conducted in 1981, it would be another two years until the SG-1000 received it's full launch, putting it in direct competition with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=866\">NES<\/a>.\nSega's arcade background meant that a number of arcade games were converted to the system, most of which were very well done. The graphics and sound may seem primitive today, but this was cutting edge technology back then and the games are still quite playable even now.\nWhile Sega marketed the console in Asia, Grandstand took care of overseas sales. The console was available in a number of countries and was popular not only in Japan but also New Zealand and Taiwan, but for some reason it was never released in America.\nA number of clones of this system were available such as the Othello Multivision and the DINA 2-in-1\/Telegames Personal Arcade, which was advertised as a <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=755\">ColecoVision<\/a> clone but it could also play SG-1000 games, a fact which most owners were unaware of!\nThe SG-1000 was followed by the SG-1000 Mark II, which was released in 1984.",

        "description": "The BT Merlin M4000 is a very obscure computer from the mid 1980s. It is allegedly based on the Logica Kennett, and should not be confused with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=871\">BT Merlin Tonto<\/a> which is a rebadged <a href=\"computer.asp?c=275\">ICL OPD<\/a>.\nThe exact application of M4000 is unknown, but it was almost certainly developed for internal use by BT and never sold on the open market. It could have been used in conjunction with System X telephone exchanges.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b>: Riaz Sobrany<\/font>\n<b>Stevie Skellett<\/b> (UK) reports:\n<font color=\"#666666\">These machines were certainly used outside of BT.   The Royal Navy used them for admin tasks in the 80's.  The machine I used had a 3.5\" 720K floppy drive and a 20MB 'Winchester' hard disk.  The OS was Concurrent DOS if I remember right.  You could have 4 virtual terminals selected from a keyboard key.  We had a vastly underrated, if not very user friendly, WP package called Lex9b.  Once you learnt all its tricks, many of which did not figure in our user documentation, you could really make it sing.  Mine also had another, similar sized, unit containing the Tape Backup Drive - backups took a *long* time!<\/font>\n<b>Ray Chester<\/b> adds:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nThe DSS used these computers. Installed and maintained by BT Merlin. The systems were built for specific functions for example \"Social Fund\" had a couple of units with Social fund software and a Dot matricx printer. These machines would keel over from any passing static charge. They also had the Asteroids game written for them lol<\/font>\n<b>Col<\/b> comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">\nMy introduction to IT. I worked on these for 5 years or so. These were used extensively outside BT. Major government contracts (as above post mentions), used by the armed forces and small companies such as solicitors etc. Also used by most of the theatres in the UK, using a box office app called RITA. They ran bespoke software apps and also had a word processor app called \"Merlinword\". Other variants had single floppy and 10 or 20meg hard drive. Also an 80meg hard drive or a Tandberg tape drive in its own casing. The RITA system even networked these together, using ARCNET. The nodes were addressed by using jumpers on a network daughter board. Oh happy days !<\/font>\n<a href=\"doc.asp?c=1258\"><img src=\"graphs\/readmore.gif\" border=\"0\" vspace=\"4\"><\/a>",

        "description": "The Kenbak-1 is considered by many to be the world's first \"Personal Computer.\" The Computer History Museum granted it this designation when they were still located in Boston in 1986. More specifically, the machine represents the first commercially available Von Neumann (stored program) computing device intended and priced for personal use. \nJohn V. Blankenbaker designed the Kenbak-1 and marketed in the pages of Scientific American in 1971. The machine's name was taken from the middle of John's last name.\nThe Kenbak-1 was designed in 1970 and pre-dated microprocessors. The Intel 4004 (the worlds first microprocessor) was introduced in 1971. Instead of being microprocessor based the Kenbak-1 was built almost entirely from TTL components. \nUnlike many earlier machines and calculating engines, the Kenbak-1 was a true stored-program computer that offered 256 bytes of memory, a wide variety of operations and a speed equivalent to nearly 1MHz.\nApproximately 40 of these machines were built and sold before they were discontinued. The world just wasn't quite ready for personal computing and the Kenbak-1 lacked some critical capabilities (such as expandability and I\/O) that were needed to foster the revolution. 14 are currently known to exist with few more likely to be discovered. \n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b>: Erik Klein<\/font>\n<b>Julian Skidmore<\/b> (Manchester, UK) comments:\n<font color=\"#666666\">Although the Kenbak-1's oscillator is 1MHz, it's clock speed was half that at 500KHz and simple calculations show it must execute instructions at an astonishingly low rate 300 instructions per second or less. This is because:\n1. Memory is 1024 bits of serial memory, so random access will take 512 cycles on average - 1000 access per second. \n2. CPU registers are placed in main memory too,  and a typical instruction involves reading\/writing the program counter, the accumulator and the instruction itself. Thus a maximum 1000\/3 = 333 instructions can execute per second.\nHaving said that, the architecture is impressive. It looks like a typical 8-bit CPU: with several registers, multiple addressing modes including indexed addressing and variable length instructions.<\/font>",

        "description": "After the huge success of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=65\">Amiga 500<\/a>, Commodore launched a new version of the machine called the Amiga 500 Plus. Some small changes were made to reduce costs and a few hardware changes were also made. It featured 1 MB of memory, the new ECS chipset and a new version of AmigaOS which wasn't 100% compatible with software written for older versions.\nWhile not officially introduced until 1992, the A500+ made a covert appearance late in 1991. Commodore apparently sold out of A500s towards the end of the year, so an unusual step was taken. The new A500+ motherboards were already in production and were placed in the old A500 cases and sold as A500s to meet demand before the launch of the new model. The only problem was that Commodore didn't tell anyone what they had done and many new users were left wondering why some Amiga software wouldn't run on their new computer.\nThe A500+ has the shortest lifespan of any Amiga ever made, it was only on sale for around six months. One way to describe the A500+ is as a mass market prototype, due to the incredibly short lifespan and the fact that the brand new version of AmigaOS was updated so quickly for its successor, the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=64\">Amiga 600<\/a>.",

After their previous effort with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=768\">C64 GS<\/a> failed and the strange decision to advertise the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=64\">Amiga 600<\/a> as a games machine that could be used as a computer it was vital that the CD32 succeeded.\nThe CD32 is notable for being the first 32 bit CD-ROM based console ever released (the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1229\">PlayStation<\/a> wasn't released until the next year). It was based on the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=628\">Amiga 1200<\/a> hardware which now had a new chip named Akiko that acted as a CD-ROM controller and I\/O chip.\nInitially the system was quite successful and managed to gain more than a 50% share of the CD-ROM based market in the U.K., where it outsold better known systems such as Sega's Mega CD and even the PC CD-ROM. Software for the CD32 was a bit of a disappointment though, mainly consisting of ports of old Amiga software with the odd video thrown in along with the obligatory CD music tracks.\nUnfortunately for Commodore their financial problems had begun to take hold by this point. The U.S. government passed a ruling that banned Commodore from importing goods into the country as they owed $10million from a patent infringement lawsuit. With the financial situation rapidly getting worse and unable to sell the CD32 in the American market, Commodore filed for bankruptcy at the end of April 1994. The unsold CD32s were seized by the government of the Philippines as payment owed by Commodore for the use of a factory.",

Internally the hardware was almost identical to the earlier Neo Geo Pocket, but now featured a colour display. \nAgain SNK released ports of their arcade games, but the most notable game must surely be Sonic The Hedgehog - Pocket Adventure, which was the first ever Sonic game to be released on non-Sega hardware. \nThe packaging for the games varied in different regions. In Japan and Europe games came in hard plastic cases, similar to those of the Mega Drive, but in the U.S. they were packaged in flimsy cardboard boxes. \nSales of the system were steady, if unspectacular, and this was the most successful Game Boy competitor since the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1109\">Game Gear<\/a>. But anticipation of Nintendo's new Game Boy Advance hampered sales and after SNK was bought by Pachinko manufacturer Aruze in 2000 the NGPC was withdrawn from the U.S. and European markets. The unsold units were recalled by SNK and repackaged for sale in Asia where the NGPC continued to be sold. \nIn 2003 the NGPC began to appear in the U.S. again. The system usually comes shrink wrapped with six games which have no boxes or instructions. These bundles have also appeared in the U.K. where they can occasionally be found in certain retro oriented games shops. At the moment it is unknown if these bundles are also available in mainland Europe.",

        "description": "If Atari started to sell a whole range of PONG systems in 1975, Magnavox (the originator of home video game systems) also started a new range of systems in 1975, the first of which was a much simpler version of the 1972 <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=883\">Odyssey<\/a>: the Odyssey 100.\nBack in 1973, Ralph Baer tried to add new features to his Odyssey (sound, extra components on the cartridges to add more visual effects, etc), and wondered if the new technologies would allow integrating a whole Odyssey in one or more simple integrated circuits. He tracked several semiconductor houses (General Instruments (GI), Texas Instruments (TI), MOSTechnology (MOSTek) and others) to study the feasibility of his new idea. He kept worrying about his idea until may 1974 when Magnavox signed an agreement with Texas Instruments for the design of the chips.\nAlthough TI promised a delivery for january 1975, Magnavox went ahead and made a same design using discrete components, should TI fail to deliver the chips. In the meantime, National Semiconductor proposed a single-chip project which would be ready for january \/ february 1975. The chip was ready in August 1975, but Magnavox already decided that TI would make the multi-chip design. Thus the Odyssey 100 was released the same year.\nThe Odyssey 100 used discrete components and four Texas Instruments chips. It did not use cartridges and played two games: TENNIS and HOCKEY. A simple switch selected the games, and the system was either powered by six batteries, or by an AC adaptor (such power supplies were widely used by other systems).\nThe TENNIS game was very basic. It was formed of two paddles, a vertical line and a ball. Two knobs were used to adjust the game: one to center the vertical line and one to set the ball speed. A little piezzo beeper was used for the few beeps of the games, and each player controlled the game using three knobs (one for moving vertically, one for moving horizontally, and one for the \"english\" effect which modified the trajectory of the ball to 'fake' the opponent).\nThe Odyssey 100 was very basic and didn't have the common features of the million-seller PONG systems of the next years. The knobs were fixed: there were no detachable controllers yet. There was no digital on-screen scoring: the players marked their score using two little plastic cursors on the system. The serve couldn't be changed: it was automatic.\nThis could seem strange compared to the first Atari PONG systems which already had digital on-screen scoring. In fact, this was just a question of technology. On-screen scoring would have required additional components, which would have increased the cost of the system. Nevertheless, on-screen scoring was added in later systems although the first attempts used archaic graphics. The first Magnavox system to offer digital on-screen was the Odyssey 300 in 1976.\nThe main features of the Odyssey 100 were very basic:\n- Action sounds \n- Mechanical Scoring \n- Top and Bottom Ball Rebound \n- Vertical\/Horizontal Player Action \n- Ball Control \n- Speed Control \n- Game Select Switch \n- On\/Off Power Switch\n____________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pong-story.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pong-story.com<\/a><\/font>",

It was the successor to the IBM PCjr, although it was compatible with IBM's bussines systems. The PS\/1 was a propriatary system at first, but standard components were used later on. The later models included \"Rapid Resume\" a standby feature.\nThe system uses a LPX form factor (layout). Everything was built into the motherboard and had a four expansion slots of 16bit ISA but on a riser card. The memory was 72pin simms.\nFor the 486SX model for example, the CPU is integrated onto the motherboard but there is a socket3 that is empty. Apparently it is possible to put in another 486 CPU and the system disables the built-in CPU, which is not possible with the 386 model.\nThe software was Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 6.2 on these systems.

        "description": "Designed by Barry Savage, the Menta looks like a Sinclair ZX-80 or ZX-81 clone, but it's not. It's rather a development tool and initiation machine based on a Z80A processor. The concept is to help you understand how a Z80A works.\nThe system itself is very similar to a Sinclair ZX-80 with its flat membrane keyboard. But when you look closer, you notice that the keybord is not quite usual like a QWERTY one for example. It's an hexadecimal one with numbers from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F. All the other keys are marked with Z80 machine language functions and instructions.\nApparently, there is no other language available than the built-in Z80 monitor. It enables you to directly program the Z80A microprocessor via the dedicated keyboard.\nThere is a RF TV video output to use any television as main display. A tape interface is here to save your work on magnetic tapes. There are even communication possibilities through a 24 i\/o line connector.\nThe Menta is very rare and was only advertised in specialised magazines, next to EPROM programmers.\nIndeed the Menta is very similar to its brother: Softy, an E-PROM programmer which used the same plastic case, almost same keyboard and had an E-PROM socket at the left part of the keyboard.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors : <\/b> Callum<\/font>",

        "description": "Little is known about this early computer from german company Triumph Adler. Hopefully, Rudolf L. Sch?rger who worked there at the time, sent us some very precious information (in German):\n\"<font color=\"#666666\">1973 begann bei Triumph-Adler die Serienproduktion der TA 1000.\nIch war damals im Pr?ffeld t?tig. Nur mit einem Oszillografen ausger?stet, mu?te ich defekte CPUs reparieren. Das ging nur deshalb, weil an die TA1000 ein Testtablau anschlie?bar war. Mit diesem konnten auf der Hardwareebene alle Funktionen eines Debuggers ausgef?hrt werden. \nInsgesamt habe ich 6 Jahre an der TA 1000 gearbeitet. Erst im Pr?ffeld, dann als Service-Techniker, dann als Programmierer. Daneben habe ich zwei IO-Karten gebaut. Je eine f?r einen 3-Farben-Strichcodeleser und einen OCR-Schriftscanner. F?r beide habe ich die Treiber und die Anwendungssoftware geschrieben.\nIch bin stolz darauf, von Anfang an dabei gewesen zu sein. Mit einem Computer, der all das konnte, was ein Desktop-Computer von IBM oder Appel erst 10 Jahre sp?ter konnte. Der einzige Nachteil der TA 1000 bestand nur darin, so gro? und schwer zu sein wie ein \"Desk\".\nDie CPU war eine Platine 28cm mal 30cm gro? mit 112 Standart-TTL ICs best?ckt. Es war eine 8Bit CPU mit 16 Bit Adresse. Der Betriebssystemspeicher war eine extra Platine mit EPROMS vom Typ 1701 best?ckt.  Als Memory gab es eine doppelbreite Platine mit 4 KByte Kernspeicher. Am Anfang gab es noch IO-Platinen f?r Tastatur, Nadeldrucker, Lochstreifenleser und Lochkartenleser, dann Kassettenband-Laufwerke. Sp?ter kamen noch Karten f?r 8 Zoll Floppydisk, SRAM Memory, verschiedene Drucker, Magnetstreifen-Buchungskarten und eine IO-Karte zum Anschlu? eines externen DF?-Modems ( dies wurde von der Post gestellt ). Sp?ter gab es dann kurz vor Einstellung der Serie noch ein Display.\nDas Betriebssystem war eigentlich nur ein Interpreter des vorcompilieren Assemblercodes. Von den 4 kByte Memory brauchte das Beriebssystem f?r sich 1 KByte, so da? f?r die Anwendungssoftware nur 3 kByte ?brig blieben. Aber es war zur Zufriedenheit aller Anwender m?glich alle n?tigen Programme f?r die B?roarbeit zu erstellen. Allerdings konnte immer nur ein Programm laufen.\nDie Software wurde am Anfang noch in Assembler geschrieben, auf Lochkarten gestanzt und eingelesen. Das fertige Programm wurde auf Magnetbandkassette gespeichert. Durch das Ausn?tzen von IO-Wartezeiten konnte man konnte man parallelaufende Tasks programmieren. Da es aber keine ?nterst?tzung durch das Betriebssystem gab wurde sowas so gut wie nie benutzt. Sp?ter gab es einen Cobol-Compiler. Sein Erfolg war aber nicht toll, da die Programme zu gro? f?r den teueren Speicher wurden.\nDie TA 1000 war durchaus ein Erfolg auf dem deutschen B?romarkt, das Konkurenzprodukt von Olivetti hatte das Nachsehen. Viele TA 1000er wurden bei Steuerberatern eingesetzt, die ?ber DF? mit ihrem Rechenzentrum DATEV verbunden waren. Viele Gemeindeverwaltungen waren mit dem Rechenzentrum AKDB verbunden. Auch die Deutsche Bundesbahn hat viele TA 1000er an ihren Fahrkartenschaltern eingesetzt.\"<\/font>\nRon Powell, who worked for Triumph Adler in Sydney, Australia on the TA 1000 series as a tech, and later a programmer, also sent us this interesting testimony: \n\"<font color=\"#666666\">The first model was a TA 1000. This was released in about 1975 ? and I attended a training course in Nuremberg, Germany for six weeks. The course was in German !!! with some rough translation done by an Italian so most of my knowledge was picked up by tinkering and reading logic and circuit diagrams. \nThe TA 1000 was built before floppy disks were in production even though we tried some prototypes. The first model was equiped with data cassettes (same size as audio cassettes). All machines had three cassette drives. We developed commercial applications - billing (invoicing where I come from), payroll etc. We had to design &amp; develop all applications from scratch because anything else was in German. The proceedure was to do data entry and capture the transaction details on cassette. This cassette was then sorted into account number order using a three tape sort. Next the customer masterfile cassette was read together with the sorted transaction cassette, the invoices printed and a new masterfile written to the third cassette with updated balance details etc. Of course there were occasional read errors during this process so we had to write some pretty complex code at a low level to get around this problem. \nThe programming language was pretty much identical to IBM 360\/370 assembler (e.g. MVC A,B,L = move L characters from B to A - or was it from A to B ?) which meant that only one typo would cause catastrophic results and probably send the system into an endless loop.<\/font>\"\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors<\/b> : Rudolf L.

There is also a power on\/off switch, but that's all for the interaction.\nThe list of the 16 games along with their screenshots are printed on the case front.\nOn the rear side, one can spot an external power supply connector (called battery eliminator by Atari), a RF TV cord to connect to the television and 4 controller (paddles) connectors label LEFT A &amp; B, and RIGHT A &amp; B.\nThe Ultra Pong Double can also be powered by 4 C battery cells.\n<b>THE GAMES<\/b>\nThe 16 games are: \n1 - pong\n2 - super pong\n3 - hyper pong\n4 - ultra pong\n5 - hockey\n6 - super hockey\n7 - hyper hockey\n8 - ultra hockey\n9 - barrier pong\n10 - super barrier pong\n11 - hyper barrier pong\n12 - ultra barrier pong\n13 - barrier hockey\n14 - super barrier hockey\n15 - hyper barrier hockey\n16 - ultra barrier hockey\nAn impressive color gradient is constantly displayed as playing background. It's darker in pong games, where ball and paddles are displayed white, and it's cleared in hickey games as ball and paddles are displayed in black.\nWhen a game is over, the system overlays a checkerboard pattern that scrolls one direction and bounces off the top and bottom every once in a while. Definitely a screen saver, but of a different kind!\n<b>PROMOTIONAL TEXT (Ultra Pong model)<\/b>\nConvert your TV screen into an ice blue hockey rink.  Fire a slap shot into the unique barrier field and dazzle your opponent with terrific speed-up and ricochet action of the puck.  Centered,  on-ice hockey goals with exciting,  behind the net action.\nMaster one...  choose among the variety of PONG or BARRIER PONG selections. Smash a volley into the barriers,  or across the net.  Change ball direction with the forward player paddle.\nMore... It's your choice!  Be a champ, play them all!\nAll this fun and it connects to any home TV set in only seconds. A flip of a switch and resume normal TV viewing.\n<b>OTHER SYSTEMS<\/b>\nAtari <b>Ultra Pong<\/b> was the same system but for two players only.\nears <b>Pong Sports IV<\/b> was the exact same system, but marketed by...

        "description": "The following description comes from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atarihq.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.atariHQ.com<\/a> website, especially <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atarihq.com\/dedicated\/stuntcycle.php\" target=\"_blank\">the Stunt Cycle dedicated page<\/a> :\n\"Considered by many collectors as the coolest of the dedicated (non-cartridge) Atari home consoles, Stunt Cycle allowed aspiring Evel Knievel wannabes the joy of performing knarly stunts -- without the risk of breaking one's neck. Tons of tricks to pull off here, from jumping cars and buses to flying over wide canyons. Based on the coin-op of the same name. \nThe original coin-op had been released in 1975 to take advantage of the then popular motorcycle stuntman Evel Knievel. Originally a motorcycle salesman who began doing stunts to draw attention to his store, by the early 70's he was a household name. Atari's coin-op attempted to capture the feel and fun of the stunt jumping Evel Knievel was famous for, and was a mild success.\nNow under Warner control and hoping to ride the crest of the Evel Knievel toy craze (even though it was near it's end), Atari decided to release a home version of Stunt Cycle. Originally codenamed \"Stunt Debbie\" during it's design, Atari Stunt Cycle (Model C-450) was released in 1977. Unfortunately 1977 also happened to be the year known for the death of the \"dedicated\" consoles, as the Fairchild Video Entertainment system had been released the year before. Known as the first programmable cartridge based console, it caused the \"pong\" market to collapse as the many pong knockoff manufacturers saw \"the end\" coming. Subsequently, they dumped their merchandise at clearance prices in an effort to get out with at least some money - unknowingly sparking what is known as the \"first great video game crash\". Atari didn't help Stunt Cycle's chances by releasing no less than 6 new pong consoles that year AND debuted it's own programmable console - the now famous Atari Video Computer System (2600). \nAs with all Atari dedicated consoles, Sears released it's own Atari manufactured version of the Stunt Cycle that same year. Called the Sears Telegames Motocross (Model 99748), Sears tried to remedy the flood problem by combining it's Ultra Sports IV console (equivalent to Atari's Pong Sports Doubles) console with Stunt Cycle. The result was a hybrid system that allowed you to plug in 4 pong paddles and play 16 different pong games along with the normal Stunt Cycle games. \nUnfortunately, the plan didn't help Sears either. Besides the dedicated console crash, Evel and his toys were on the way out by the late 1970's due to his decreasing popularity after a series of failed stunts \"\n<b>Commercial text taken from the system box<\/b>:\n\"Jump 32 buses in your living room!\n- Converts any TV into a racetrack with competition event for all members of the family.\n- Designed with different skill levels, for handicapping. Always challenging, even for experts.\n- Once you get the hang on it, go for it and put the difficulty switch in the \"PRO\" position. Be careful.\"",

Looking at the picture, the PCC seems to be conceived as a monobloc machine, where the display and two 8\" floppy disk drives are built-in the main case. The keyboard (AZERTY here) with its separated numeric and editing keypads is not detachable.\nThe system is powered by an Intel 8085 microprocessor and offers 64 KB RAM. The whole thing was apparently delivered with an extended Basic language, which has DOS commands built-in to control the disk drives.\nOptions advertised were: \n- CP\/M, Cobol, Fortran, Basic compiler languages\n- 10 MB hard disk\n- wordprocessor software\n- multi-terminals\n- multi-tasking\nAs you can see we don't much about this system, help is largely welcomed.",

This SD-290 model was sold worldwide through different brands (in France for example by ITMC and Jou?Club)...\nAll these systems were surely produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as they have code-names like \"SD-2xx\" (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!! \nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=792\">Cassette Vision<\/a> from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\nThe Soundic SD-290 is square shaped, the case is white and blue colored with orange buttons and controls. It was delivered with only one controller which connects to the left side of the system. There is a second connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player controller, but as all the games were for one player only, it was never used. The controller can be stored in its compartment located on the top of the console. It is composed of a 4-directions disc on which can be screwed a little stick. There is also a knob for Breakout-type games and an orange fire button.\nThe control panel is made of three buttons and an on\/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top-left part of the console, just above the joystick storage compartment. Like on the HMG-7900, the case is labeled \"Programmable Color Video Game\". Inside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Nothing is known about this one... can you help please?\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Command or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.",

The PDS-1 debuted in 1970 and is considered to be the predecessor of all later graphical minicomputers and modern computer workstations. The PDS-1 had a built-in display list processor and 4096 16-bit words of core RAM. The PDS-1 used a vector display processor for displaying vector graphics as opposed to the raster graphics of modern computer displays. The PDS-1 was often used with another flagship Imlac product, a typesetting program called CES.\nThe PDS-1 was used in many pioneering computer applications. The FRESS hypertext system had enhanced capability and usability if accessed from a PDS-1 system; the user could make hyperlinks with a light pen and create them simply with a couple of keystrokes. Multi-window editing on FRESS was also possible when using the PDS-1.\nThe PDS-1 also had the capability to run remote graphical programs such as those that ran on the Stanford AI Lab's main computer. The PDS-1 was also able to run Mazewar, the first online multiplayer computer game. The PDS-1 connected to a host PDP-10 computer (located at MIT) running ITS over Arpanet and the Mazewar program. Up to 8 players running PDS-1 minicomputers or other terminals could access MIT's Mazewar host. The PDS-1 was also important during the early days of Arpanet when network graphics protocols were under consideration.\n<i>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Imlac_PDS-1\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/i>",

        "description": "TAP 34 is a self design of Terta company from Hungary. Primarily it was designed as a terminal for big computer systems but it was also able to process data alone. The main integrated circuits were assembled in the USSR and in Hungary by Tungsram, but several parts were imported from other countries.\nThe built-in monitor was a DME-28 monochrome CRT made by Orion. This company    was famous for its televisions in Hungary and the other KGST countries.\nThe floppy drive attached to the computer was regular 8 inch 77 track drive using IBM format. This drive, which could use single and double sided disks, was a hungarian product also, made by the MOM.\nThe first design had some communications software in the EPROM, but at the end of the 80's the computer was redesigned. This second design had only 2 kBytes of EPROM, containing the bootloader software for the CP\/M. The CPU card, the Ram card, the CRT card and the floppy controller card were all placed into a coloured plastic case.\nThe system was designed around the classic 8080 circuits.\n- Display controller: i8275\n- Floppy controller: i8271\n- DMA: i8257\n- i8255 PIO, i8253 CTC, i8251 USART\nTAP-34 had the number EC-8534 in the EC-serries (united serries of computers) of East block and ex-USSR. Abbrevation \"TAP\" states for Teletype Abonents Point. There were three known modifications of EC-8534: original one, EC-8534.02, and EC-8534.3. The last one had optional capability to boot CP\/M clone called VDOS.\nThe standard software included some built-in teletype programs and BASIC (Terta-BASIC). There was also a so called DP (Developer Package) floppy bootable system for assembly development (included editor, assembler and debugger).\nSome constructive features of TAP-34 and the mentioned software suggest that there was some prototype CPU as well as original development software which were borrowed to design the TAP-34.\n________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Kun-Szabo Marton, Cyril Murzin\n<b>Source =<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.machines.hu\/hirek_cikkek\/cikkek\/tap34\/tap34.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.machines.hu<\/a><\/font>",

The mechanical keyboard offers  separated numeric and editing keypads.\nThe system is powered by an Intel 8085 microprocessor and offers 64 KB RAM. The whole thing was apparently delivered with an extended Basic language, which has DOS commands built-in to control the disk drives.\nOptions advertised were: \n- CP\/M, Cobol, Fortran, Basic compiler languages\n- 10 MB hard disk\n- wordprocessor software\n- multi-terminals\n- multi-tasking\n\nThe PCC 2000 was originaly called the MITS 300\/15 and renamed to reflect the Pertec brand. This machine replaced the MITS Altair S-100 computers.\nThe PCC 2000 was also marketed by Ordisor in France, as the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1292\">Ordisor PCC 2000<\/a>.",

The Nano was somewhat expensive and suffered from a number of minor problems which prevented its use in the market for which it had been originally designed. Quite how much this prompted Midwich to proceed with their own system is not clear, but the influence is plainly here.\n<b>Construction<\/b>\nThe case of the Microcontroller is made out of structured foam sitting on a steel chassis. It is certainly rigid but its impact strength (ie dropping things onto its top), may be suspect. The top of the case is both wide and deep enough to allow a portable TV or monitor to sit on it. One nice touch is that the ventilation slots are covered internally with mesh thus preventing thke ingress of paper clips and the like.\nThe steel chassis extends up to form the rear panel of the unit and is securely attached to the lid. Indeed, there are so many fixing screws that\nonly the most determined \"peeker\" will have the patience to remove them and gain access to the inside! Once into the interior the overall impression is of neatness. Everything is well laid out, all the components are of top grade and the whole unit has the appearance of being built to last.",

This unit had a memory\/storage capacity of 2 x 8 MB (Winchester technology).\nTriumph Adler said the system (the 1600) will fit the demand of medium-sized businesses, due to the facts that these companies will need more storage capacities and much more flexibility at the external storage solutions.\nFor the 1600\/20 as well as the 1600\/30 models were new 64 KB chipset modules available which extended the RAM to a maximum of 1 MB.\nSoftware on the 1600 systems had the focus on the classic office computing (EDP). The standard package was called \"TABS 1600\" and included applications like, payroll accounting, stock management. But also, there were applications for special businesses available.\nThe pricing of the 1600 family started at 13.000 DM (German Mark) for a single system up to 250.000 DM for a \"Multi-user-dialogue-system\".\n_________\n<font color=\"#666666\"><b>Contributors:<\/b> Dirk, Moya<\/font>",

        "description": "Olivetti introduced a mainframe about 1960 which was called ELEA, then in 1965 the Programma 101 - which was probably the world's first real desktop computer. Then a little later they introduced the Audiotronic range of \"office computers\". The first was the A770, which was replaced by the A7. The A5 was the desktop version.\nThe Olivetti Audit 5 or A5 was largely an electro mechanical computer. It printed via a golf ball typewritter mechanism at the astonishing speed of 16 character per second (CPS).\nIt was a machine that was designed to meet a use that was quickly dying out at the time, visual record computers, that is electronic ledger machines. These were fast being replaced by screen based computers.\nAccording to a former australian computer reseller (Geoff Greig), the A5 and A6 models had problems were they would catch on fire!\nHe also recalls: \"<i>Some of the customers I had would start printing a report at close of business one day and come in the next morning to find it still printing. However the print mechanism being so mechanical often such a big print run would result in a breakdown. I tink Olivetti in Australia made more money out of Maintaince agreements than selling computers.\nAnd the sound was liike a machine gun. Not the sort of thing you would was to having printing beside you. Some people even made giant sound boxes to put them it to try and reduce the noise.\nThe 2030 had a dot matrix printer that printed at the outstandind 100 cps and was much more reliable.<\/i>\"\nThe BCS 2030 (BCS stands for Business Computer System) was a vast improvement on the the machine the Olivetti A5. The BCS 2030 Floppy disk version replaced the A6. The A6 being an A5 with a dual 128K floppy drives and still the 16 CPS printer.\nHere is what <a href=\"www.storiaolivetti.it\" target=\"_blank\">www.storiaolivetti.it<\/a> says about the A5:\n<i>\"The Audit A5, introduced in 1974, is an accounting system with the characteristics of a real computer. It has a central unit (Micro 8, designed Olivetti), RAM, hard disk and removable disks, magnetic cards, adjustable, built-in printer, the programming language BASIC owner (LIMO, Interactive machine language Olivetti). As the \"elder brother\" A7, presented simultaneously, the system A5 is designed with the logic of modular and can be expanded according to user needs, such as the A7 has no video, but unlike ' A7, which looks like a desk job, the A5 is a desktop machine. The design is reminiscent of the typewriter, also to be more easily accepted by the environment secretary.

It means that all these systems can directly use the same cartridges.\nThe Software library is not very impressive, but there are good reasons for that. First, some titles ar almost just direct ports from \"Interton VC-4000 &amp; compatible systems\" group. Philips (remember, at the origin of this ystem) also had great plans for his new hardware platform. It released adaptations of famous Arcade classics (Pac-Man, Berzerk, Phoenix, etc.) but Atari sue them. Philips was then forced to deeply modify those games, resulting in poor adaptations... at least for the Arcadia 2001. Because, outside US, other compatible systems sometimes had un-modified version in their library (Robot Killer for the MPT-03, for example).\nThe Arcadia is equiped with two detachable controllers made of a screwable joystick, a 12-buttons keypad (flat membrane buttons) and 2 fire buttons (they in fact have both the same function). Small plastic layers were delivered with each game, explaining the different key functions when placed over the keypads (like with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellisivision<\/a>).\nThe Control panel is made of 4 buttons (Start, Clear, Select A and Select B) and the power on\/off button.",

He already imagined several early computer designs before this Fred model, such as the System 00 or the original Fred concept.\nFred (Flexible Recreational &amp; Educational Device) is in fact a concept imagined by Joseph Weisbecker for an educational computer able to play games. This concept emerged in several hardware versions through time. The first models could be dated as early as 1970 or 1971 !\nThe first models (like the one code-named System 00) used only small-scale digital TTL logic chips, the Fred computer picture here is the first system of the project to use integrated chipsets, particularly the RCA's COSMAC 1801 chip set, which would later become the single-chip COSMAC 1802.\nAll the incredible work initiated by Joseph Weisbecker eventually led to the RCA Cosmac line of computers (like The <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1255\">Microtutor<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=543\">Cosmac VIP<\/a>) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=728\">RCA Studio II gaming system<\/a>, among other projects.\n__________\n<i>Photo of the Fred computer courtesy of the Sarnoff Collection, The College of New Jersey<\/i>",

        "description": "The Wang 2200 appeared in May 1973, and was Wang Laboratories' first minicomputer that could perform data processing in a common computer language: BASIC. It had a cathode ray tube (CRT) built-in its case and also an integrated computer-controlled cassette tape storage unit. 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide.\nThere has been quite several diffent models of the 2200:\n- 2200A : first models released in 1973\n- 2200B : offers additional commands in Wang BASIC, mostly related to data handling\n- 2200C : added a small number of additional commands, including basic error handling.\n- 2200S : new LSI CPU, and more commands to convert strings to and from numbers\n- 2200T : same as the S model, plus a complete set of matrix math commands\n- 2200 WCS : model \"T\" + tape\/disk\/hard-disk + terminal all integrated in a furniture table\n- 2200 PCS : stands for Personal Computer System. Released in 1976, electronic has been redesigned to fit into the terminal case. It's the model pictured here.\n- 2200 WS : PCS whithout tape or disk, meant to be connected to a 2200 WCS configured with a disk multiplexer\n- 2200 PCS II : a PCS system that had a dual 5.25\" floppy disk system bolted on top of the terminal. Released in june 1977.\n\nOne interesting feature of the PCS II model, is that it was this computer that the 5.25\" floppy disk was invented for! Wang decided that 8\" drives would be too cumbersome for this class of machine, so they contacted Shugart for development of the smaller drives and media.\nUnlike the other product lines such as the VS and OIS, Wang Laboratories aggressively used value-added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with Hawaii and Hong Kong-based firm, Algorithms, Inc. It provided paging (beeper) services for much of the Hong Kong market in the early 1980s.",

Telegames never advertised its compatibility with the SG-1000.\nThe Dina's controllers are modeled after the D-pads made famous by the Nintendo Entertainment System. The cables connecting the system are attached to the side of the controllers, making them difficult to grasp comfortably. Since the controllers are too small to possess numeric keypads, a single numeric keypad is present on the console itself. Any ColecoVision game that requires two keypads cannot be used. A difference in the Dina's controller wiring prevents use of Coleco's Roller Controller and Super Action Controllers and games dependent on either one.\nThe Dina does not include the ColecoVision expansion module interface; ColecoVision games that rely on expansion modules cannot be used. The console is not compatible with all ColecoVision cartridges, partly from its lack of a second numeric keypad. Expansion modules for the ColecoVision are also incompatible, as the expansion port is of a completely different pinout and shape. Some units possess a manufacturer's defect that causes the system to draw too much power into the motherboard, causing damage after long-term play.\nThe Telegames Personal Arcade was advertised as an alternative to the ColecoVision, leaving the function of the Sega SG-1000 cartridge port unexplained. Despite this, SG-1000 games are completely functional. The console does not have a port for the Sega My Card games, but the \"Sega Card Catcher\" peripheral is compatible and allows for Sega My Card games to be played.\nThe Dina came with the game Meteoric Shower built into the unit. The ColecoVision's boot screen is replaced with Japanese writing and the words \"1986 BIT CORPORATION\" on a green background.\nThe remaining stock of the DINA 2 in 1 was destroyed in 1994 when a tornado hit the Telegames warehouse.\n<font color=\"#666666\">Source: Wikipedia<\/font>",

It was one of the first high-end microcomputers and among the first desktop personal computers to offer a bitmap graphics display.\nIt was capable of running a stripped version of UNIX version 6. It was the first personal machine on which the UCSD p-System was widely used. Various universities in the USA used it in the late 1970s through mid-1980s to teach Pascal programming. It provided immediate graphic feedback from simple programs encouraging students to learn.\nA complete disk operating system is available including single and multi-user BASIC, FORTRAN IV, APL and PASCAL.\nWhile the 8510 Data Processor is the computer itself, the The 8510\/a Graphics Computer System consists of the Model 8510 Data Processor, with FIS\/EIS (Hardware floating point option) a 56K Byte memory\/ video controller unit and the Model 8532 Keyboard\/ Display.\nThis special configuration provides the user with a flexible disc based digital computer system, programmable through a variety of standard languages, with the added capabilities of producing medium resolution raster scan graphics. User programs can display both characters and graphics, independently or simultaneously in any combination of three zones in the display area. The character dot pattern is alterable through program control of a writeable character generator (192 character set capability) facilitating any special character representation desired including foreign language character sets.\nThree entrepreneurs created the company in 1975: Brian Benzar, William Mayberry and Dennis Kodimer. Terak products were manufactured in Scottsdale, Arizona from 1976 thru 1984. Sales reached $10M and Terak was publicly traded in 1983-84.

        "description": "The Vid?o Ordinateur MPT-05 is one of the many systems \"software-compatible\" with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a> or the Radofin 1292 to name a few.\nThough, the Interton VC-4000 is the maybe most popular system of this console group, it was not necessarily at the origin of it. Things must be seen differently. Philips \/ Signetics developped a hardware platform to demonstrate the possibilities of their Signetics 2650 &amp; 2636 chipsets. Somehow, this hardware was licenced to many third-companies around the world resulting in systems like the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=726\">Interton VC-4000<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1189\">Voltmace DataBase<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=906\">Acetronic MPU-1000<\/a>, Radofin 1292, etc.\nMost electronic boards of these systems were build in Asia by companies such as Radofin or Soundic. The codename \"MPT\" was also used by other system families: MPT-02 products are RCA Studio II compatible systems, MPT-03 are \"Emerson Arcadia 2001 compatible\" systems and MPT-04 and MPT-05 are \"Interton VC-4000 compatible\" systems.\nSome times later, the hardware was improved, with the use of a Signetics 2637 instead of the 2636 (handling the audio &amp; video), somehow resulting in a new wave of licenced systems, all based on the same hardware and playing the same games. This console group includes : the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=835\">Emerson Arcadia 2001<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1181\">Advision Home-Arcade<\/a>, Prestige MPT-03, Tele-Fever, etc.\nAll these systems (based on the 2650 &amp; 2636 chipsets) are \"software-compatible\" with each others. It means that they all could play each other games if their cartridge slots were identical (which is not the case, resulting in sub-groups).\nThe Vid?o Ordinateur MPT-05 was marketed in France by ITMC. What is quite strange is that other systems use the exact same plastic case such as the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1191\">Intervision 2001<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1190\">Intervision 3001<\/a>, or the Sheen Home Video Centre 2001 (Australia) and the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=829\">Ormatu Video Spelcomputer 2001<\/a> (Netherlands), but they are not compatible with the MPT-05! Indeed the ITMC MPT-05 is an \"Interton VC-4000 compatible\" system (2650\/2636 chipsets combo), whereas the other are \"Arcadia 2001 compatible\" systems (2650\/2637 chipsets combo)! What a mess...\nThe MPT-05 is equiped with two detachable controllers made of a screwable analog joystick and a 14-buttons keypad (rubber buttons). Small plastic layers were delivered with each game, explaining the different key functions when placed over the keypads (like with the <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=1205\">Mattel Intellivision<\/a>).\nThe Control panel is made of 4 buttons (Start, Clear, Select A and Select B) and the power switch.",

        "description": "The PHC-10 was released at the same time as the PHC-20 and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=192\">PHC-25<\/a>, in 1982. Sanyo wanted to offer a perfect line of products for computing initiation. These three models were supposed to be complementary. But despite high hopes, they just were flops and it's not clear if the PHC-10 was even really sold, as only one or two were found until today, excepts for press pictures from the 80s.\nPHC stands for \"Personal Home Computer\". The PHC-10 was the entry-level system of the trio. It offered a version of Tiny Basic stored in ROM and a built-in LCD display of 1 line by 16 characters. Characters are displayed through a 5x7 pixels matrix. Editing of the program lines are facilitated by the use of the orange arrow keys.\nThe Tiny Basic is stored in a 4KB ROM inside the purpose-designed chip also used as the processor, and the computer offers 2KB RAM which can be expanded to 4KB max. The PHC-20 has even a built-in buzzer to produce sound and music through the BEEP command.\nApart from the NEC chip acting as microprocessor and ROM, the motherboard is almost empty !\nThe set of BASIC commands are:\nRUN, NEW, LIST, SIZE, RETURN, REM, END, FOR, NEXT, STEP, INPUT, PRINT, IF, GOTO, GOSUB, LET, RND, ABS, BEEP, PAUSE.\nThis is the minimum to program something interesting. This Basic only handles integers. Thus dividing 5 by 3 will give you a result of 1 !\nTo overcome the 1 line display limitation, the PAUSE command can be used to replace PRINT. While PRINT will need you to press RETURN each time to read the next line, PAUSE will print the line for 1 second, and then display the next one.\nThe computer could be powered by 4 AA cells and was supposed to last for 80 hours ! It even could retain data when in sleep mode, which is automatically activated if the the computer is not used for 5 minutes. That made the PHC-10 a real portable computer in 1982, a bit like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=143\">Epson HX-20<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=364\">Casio FP-200<\/a> both released the same year.\nSurprisingly, it looks very similar to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=447\">Laser 50<\/a> from Video Technology released three years later in 1985. In 1982, the PHC-10 was meant to compete against initiation computers like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=262\">Sinclair ZX-80<\/a> or <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">ZX-81<\/a>, or pocket computers like the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=965\">Sharp PC-1500<\/a> or the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=937\">Tandy TRS80 PC-1<\/a>.",

HOW\n?? WHAT\n?? SORRY\n... but that is very obscure and doesn't help at all solving the problem as it doesn't even give the line number incriminated.\nTalking about limitations, the computer offer no color display, no sound and its Basic can only handle integers. It could have competed with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=263\">Sinclair ZX81<\/a> which had the same limitations but it was much more expensive. Thus, the Sanyo PHC-20 is an extremely rare machine and very few were (apparently) ever sold !",

        "description": "The CEFUCOM 21 is a very strange computer ! It was built around a <a href=\"computer.asp?c=192\">Sanyo PHC-25<\/a> to be used as a computer-aided teaching and learning system (to learn English for example).\nA tape recorder is built-in the left side of the plastic case. The tape deck can read data on one channel and audio on the other. This feature is used by the system to output audio instructions at the same time as its loads data programs into the computer. The tape deck can also be used independently from the computer (see below). Classic connectors associated with the tape deck are to be found on the left of the case: Phones, Line out, Mic and Aux In. Below the capsules' window display (see below), there are two sliders used to control the volume and the balance.\nBut the most incredible part is the built-in display on the left of the case, just below the tape deck. On might think that this is a LCD screen, but it's not. It's only a plastic transparent window to show what is behind. Teaching programs were delivered with \"capsules\" which look like a book in a box. When this box is inserted into the (huge) dedicated slot, the visuals contained in the capsule are synchronized with the corresponding data program to be displayed behind the small window. When the visual changes, a black shutter hide what's happening behind, and then reveals the new visual. This is very impressive to watch !\nThe CEFUCOM 21 is thus a very innovative system mixing electro-mechanical-controlled visuals, with real computed display, computing data from the tape and real audio instructions coming out also from the tape ! A real multimedia system in 1983.\nThe system can also be used as a normal computer and is BASIC compatible with the Sanyo PHC-25 and NEC PC-6000. Under CEFUCOM BASIC 1.0, a bit less than 32KB RAM is available for the user.\nWhen the computer is switched on, the following menu is displayed on the screen:\n1 - See\/Modify the planning of your lessons\n2 - Study a lesson\n3 - BASIC\n4 - audio recording\/reading mode\nOption 1 is not clear... Does it show you information about your lessons schedules and progressions, or can it be used to create new lessons ?\nOption 2 will ask you to insert the correct capsule into the computer.\nOption 3 must be chosen to use the system as a normal computer, like a PHC-25 on steroids.\nOption 4 is intended to use the tape deck alone to listen to music or record something (trough the AUX IN or MIC connectors on the left of the computer).\nThe audio features which were optional through the PSG-01 expansion box for the Sanyo PHC-25 are he built-in the system, offering 3 voices of 8 octaves, as well as the two DB9 \"Atari compatible\" joysticks connectors.\nAbove the keyboard are a set of buttons used to interact with the lessons (buttons 1 to 8) and also to manually control the tape deck (RECORD, PLAY, REWIND, F.FWD, STOP, PAUSE). There are also buttons and switches to control the built-in clock and alarm option. There is also a serie of LED indicators used to show various informations such which MODE the system is in, or the progress of the study\/lessons.\nThere is also a ROM CARTRIDGE slot, but its purpose is unknown. Was it intended for something special, or never used ? The Sanyo PHC-25 didn't have a cartridge slot, but the NEC PC-6001, which is very close technically, did...\nAnother curiosity is the DIN8 plug found at the back of the system, labeled \"COUPLER\". Did they intend to connect the CEFUCOM-21 to the outside world though a modem ? It's incredible to think that the developpers tried to put every features they could in this beast in 1983 !",

        "description": "The System 00 is an early computer constructed by Joseph Weisbecker around 1971-72, when he was working at RCA. His goal was to conceive an educational computer able to play games, so that children could easily experience and understand how a computer works. This idea later evolved in <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1308\">FRED systems<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=543\">COSMAC computers<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?st=2&amp;c=728\">Studio II game system<\/a>.\nAll logic circuits in the System 00 utilize 7400 series TTL chips. Though it contains no microprocessors, the general architecture of the System 00 eventually evolved into the RCA's COSMAC 1801 chip set, and later the single-chip COSMAC 1802.\nThe system case houses the logic circuits, power supply, input-output interfaces, 1024 bytes of memory and a control panel. This control panel is made of many switches for binary entries and operation controls, LEDs, buttons (RUN for example) and an hexadecimal keyboard (0-9, A-F).\nMemory can be expanded to 64KB max. Word length is 8 bits. Two machine cycles of 1.6 us minimum are required per instruction, resulting in a max instruction execution rate of 300K operations per second. A direct memory access channel permits independent, asynchronous input\/output up to 200K bytes\/sec. An external program interrupt line is also provided.\nVideo display is made possible through an XYZ oscilloscope. Two display modes are available: 32x32 or 16x64 matrix of dots. This requires 128 bytes of memory from the 1024 bytes available. The 16x64 mode permits 4 lines of up to 10 characters per line in 5x7 dot format.\nThe System 00 can be connected to a card reader. Cards are 3\"x5\" punched card and only one can be read at a time. The cards are manually dropped into a top slot and read photoelectrically while falling. A card is divided in two tracks (A &amp; B). Only one track is read at a time. The \"A\" track is read by dropping the card in the reader with the \"A\" arrow down. The card is then turned around for the \"B\" track to be read. Each track can contain up to 12 bytes. A manual card punch is also provided.\nThe system 00 can also use an auxiliary \"yes\/no\" switch box for simplefied interactions with the system and programs by unsophisticated users. The state of these switches can be read by the programs.\nPrograms can be entered via the hexadecimal keyboard, entering first the less significant digit, followed by the most significant digit. Programs can also be loaded via the punch card reader.",

        "description": "The Sysdata JR computer is a Brazilian clone of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=409\">Tandy TRS-80 Model 1<\/a>.\nWithin the white molded plastic case, is a single printed circuit board equipped with a Z80A 8-bit CPU cadenced at 1.78MHz. It can operate at 3.56MHz through an optional modification.\nThe 12 KB ROM memory includes the OS and BASIC Level II interpreter. There is also a 2 KB EPROM (socketed) for additional chips. For example, it could be used for extension of the operating system and BASIC interpreter, called EXTENDED BASIC, which had fourteen additional commands, many of them available only on Disk BASIC.\nThe basic model of the JR is delivered with 16 KB RAM but can be internally expanded up to 48 KB (64 KB in the disk version).\nAt the rear of the computer is the system bus (standard S80 with fifty data lines). There can also be found connectors for two cassette recorders (!), composite video output, RF video output and voltage selection switch (110\/220V), ON\/OFF switch, RESET button and video mode switch (normal\/inverse).\nThrough the expansion bus, dot matrix printers could be connected, through a standard Centronics parallel interface; RS-232C type programmable interface card, asynchronous serial (modem connection point for telephone line), real-time clock card, voice synthesizer, Atari type joystick and optical pen.\nThe standard auxiliary memory device is the common audio cassette recorder (500 baud). The JR can control up to two recorders simultaneously through separate connections for EAR (read), MIC (write) and REMOTE (for motor control).\nIf you want to use 5.25-inch floppy disk drives, you must add a controller board to the expansion bus, which has a capacity of up to four 5.25\" or 8\" floppy disk drives, single or dual-density. The single-density drive has 100KB capacity per floppy disk, while the dual-density drive has 184KB capacity.\nThe basic model includes BASIC Level II language. You can use other languages from tapes such as ASSEMBLER Z80 (ADTASM), Tiny PILOT, Tiny PASCAL, etc. With a disk drive you can use more powerful languages, including BASIC interpreters and compilers, FORTRAN, COBOL, PASCAL, FORTH, RPG, ALGOL, etc. Some basic utilities are included in the SYSDOS operating system. With the CP\/M 2.2 operating system, a large number of software was also available.\nThe keyboard is of calculator type with flat square rubber keys which makes typing difficult. There is also a professional version of the JR computer with an mechanical keyboard. Control keys allow program interruption (BREAK), screen clearing (CLEAR), cursor movement, upper\/lower case, etc.\nThe video unit can be either a regular TV (black and white or color), with modulated RF output, connected directly through the external antenna, or a professional monochrome video monitor connected to the composite video output (simultaneous connection is possible !).\nThe graphics capability of JR Sysdata is the same as the TRS-80, i.e. low resolution of 128x48, individually addressable pixels. With the additional EPROM option, the character generator incorporates upper and lower case letters, in addition to 64 semigraphic characters, and also makes available another 96  characters, which can eventually be redefined (?).\nThis computer was followed by the JR III, compatible with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=18\">Tandy TRS-80 Model III<\/a>.\n__________\n<font color=\"#666666\">Thanks to mci.org.br for most info.<\/font>",

        "description": "The Maxxi was one of the first Brazilian clones of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=68\">Apple II<\/a> and Apple II+.\nIt was manufactured in 1982 by Polymax, a subsidiary of Abicomp, which headquarters were located in Porto Alegre. Polymax also manufactured larger computers for commercial applications. \nIt has a slightly different design than other Apple-compatibles, with a taller case that supposedly facilitated internal ventilation.\nDue to the success of Apple in the North American market, several Brazilian manufacturers produce Apple compatible computers, to benefit from one of the largest application software libraries available in the world.\nMaxxi followed the same philosophy as Apple, facilitating user access to internal circuits. Despite having a design a little different\/taller from other Apple II compatibles, Maxxi has the same electronics as the original North American product. Its case has a cover that can be easily removed, giving access to the circuit board and expansion connectors.\nBased on the 6502 microprocessor, the Maxxi operates at a clock frequency of 1 MHz. The user has at his disposal eight internal connectors (slots) where he can place memory expansions, printer interfaces or floppy disk drives expansion cards. It's also possible to add a very large set of expansion boards, with the most diverse functions.\nThe 12 KB ROM contains in addition to the operating system (monitor), the Polysoft BASIC language. RAM can go from 16 KB to 64 KB on the motherboard itself. Thanks to the expansion board and software-aided addressing, the RAM memory can go up to 128 KB.\nLike all computers of the Apple lineage, the Maxxi can be operated with a second microprocessor through a Z80 expansion card. It then can use CP\/M, widely used in larger microcomputers and featuring a large number of programs for commercial applications. The RAM memory added by the Z80 board overwrites the ROM memory, which can only be used by the 6502, resulting in 64KB of RAM, available to the CP\/M.\nMaxxi has four analog inputs for connecting game controllers (joysticks); without the need for additional interfaces, a cassette recorder can also be connected as an auxiliary memory unit.\nDepending on the number of expansion boards placed in the Maxxi, ventilation may be necessary to avoid heating problems. This is performed by a small fan attached to the side of the power supply, ejecting hot air outside of the Maxxi.\nMaxxi's ON\/OFF switch is located in the top right corner of the case instead of being on the back panel as with other models in the Apple family. On the back are the connectors for the cassette recorder, the output for the video monitor and three holes for peripherals cables such as floppy disk drive and printer.\nMaxxi's keyboard is QWERTY with 51 keys. As with the other models based on the Apple II Plus, the keyboard is relatively simple, with no separate numeric keypad or full cursor movement keys (only left and right). Some characters, which are obtained with the combination SHIFT and other alphabetic keys, are not engraved on the keys. For example, the @ character is obtained with the SHIFT-P keys. With the ESC key, you can move the cursor to a certain position on the screen and edit the content of a program line, or \"use\" a command already written to execute it again. By pressing ESC once, the I, J, K and M keys command the cursor movement in the four directions. Pressing ESC again turns the cursor movement mode off. On the other hand, the simultaneous combination of the CTRL key with some alphabetic keys results in control commands, such as processing interruption (CTRL-C), sounding alarm (CTRL-G) and others.\nThe default video output of the Maxxi is composite. Altogether, sixteen colors can be generated, producing color images with low or high resolution. Working in high resolution, the number of available colors is reduced to six, two of them with two different shades.\nThe default text resolution consists of 24 lines of 40 columns with uppercase characters only. Low graphic resolution offers 40 x 48 (big) pixels or 40 x 40 pixels plus four lines of text at the bottom of the screen. At high resolution you can access 280 x 192 dot graphics on the full screen or 280 x 160 dot graphics with four lines of text. At high resolution, Maxxi uses 8 KB from the main RAM. 80 columns display is possible with an expansion card.\nFor data storage, the Maxxi uses a tape recorder in its most basic version. The data transfer and read speed for the cassette is 1200 baud, or approximately 120 characters per second. You can of course add floppy disk drives and hard disk drives (Winchester type). Each 5 ?-inch floppy disk drive can store approximately 150 KB. Each floppy disk control board (interface) can command two floppy disk drives.\nThe operating system and the BASIC language, residing in 12 KB of ROM, are the same as the original Apple II+. The disk operating system is compatible with Apple DOS 3.0, and Polysoft BASIC with Applesoft, both with translated error messages in portuguese. DOS needs to be loaded and works in conjunction with BASIC. The characters shown on the screen can be in reverse, flashing or normal mode.\nUsing the Z80 expansion board with the CP\/M operating system, instead of using ROM-resident BASIC, you can have use many other languages such as MBASIC and CBASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, etc.",

        "description": "A quite little strange computer, which appeared under different designs...\nThe Rabbit Computer RX83 was announced at the 1983 CES. It looks like the computer was produced in Hong-Kong and then proposed to several companies in the rest of the world to market the computer under their own brand.\nSee the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=420\">GEM 1000 computer<\/a> entry for such an example.\nHowever no such computers have been found so far, maybe proving that the original company failed to produce the computer, or that it canceled the project at last minute, or that so few were sold that it's difficult to find a specimen today...\nBut if you look at the pictures section of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=420\">GEM 1000 computer<\/a>, you'll notice the that the computer evolved in different plastic cases. The \"Charlemagne\" picture, shows a case and keyboard identical to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=331\">CCE MC1000 computer<\/a>. This could mean that the project was finally marketed in Brazil, exclusively for CCE.\nMoreover, the games advertised in the 1983 promotional leaflet were indeed released for the CCE MC-1000. Thus we can say for certain that Rabbit RX83 computer eventually evolved into the CCE MC-1000.\nAdam Trionfo reports in Digital Press forum (<a href=\"https:\/\/forum.digitpress.com\/forum\/showthread.php?109595-Rabbit-Computer-RX83-Anyone-Heard-of-It\" target=\"_blank\">source link<\/a>), about the RX83 flyer:\n<span style=\"text-indent: 40px; color:#666666\">\"This flyer was handed out to Bob Fabris at, I think, the Summer CES show in June of 1983. Bob was the the editor of the Arcadian newsletter (for the Bally Arcade\/Astrocade) in 1983. He was extremely interested in the Rabbit RX83, as he felt he could provide software for this quite-limited machine.\nLike the Astrocade, which had 1.8K available to BASIC, the Rabbit RX83 shipped with just 2KB of RAM. In fact, Robert was working out a deal in which programs that had been previously written for the Astrocade would be ported to the Rabbit RX83 computer. The final deal would have cost Rabbit computer $2,500-$5,000 for each program ported to the RX83. I do have all of the paperwork exchanged between Rabbit Computer's president, Daniel Young, in Hong Kong and Bob Fabris; it's quite fascinating!\nUnfortunately, the Rabbit RX83 was not released in the United States. The system was released in Belgium as the GEM 1000 and in Hong Kong as the Rabbit RX83. It also was released as the CCE MC-1000 in Brazil in 1985.\nOther documentation in the Bob Fabris collection includes flyers for the Rabbit II, which had a proper full-stroke keyboard and 80K RAM (which sounds like they were including ROM and RAM).\"<\/span>",

        "description": "A year after the announcement of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1328\">Rabbit RX83 Color Computer<\/a>, the Hong-Kong based company reveal their new computer: the Wrap Bit II.\nIt's weird machine powered by a Z80, built-in an IBM style keyboard and offering full Coleco Adam compatibility (with the right optional interface) ! Problem, we don't even know if the Wrap Bit II was ever really released...\nOn power up the machine displays the \"Rabbit Computer Inc\" logo and waits for a key to be pressed.\nThe BASIC has several instructions to handle sprites, character (re)definitions, graphics and sound. There is even a DEBUG instruction that give access to a machine code monitor allowing memory and its content to be listed, altered or moved.\nAll the computer holds into an IBM style keyboard with function keys and keypad, though the quality is not the same. It is possible to enter BASIC keywords, Sinclair style, at a single keypress by using the SHIFT key or SHIFT LOCK (just as it was the case with the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1328\">Rabbit RX83<\/a>). The function keys found on the left of the keyboard can be used to set up screen colors. The bottom two keys enable the paper and ink colors to be cycled through.\nAll input from the keyboard is in upper case, the SHIFT key being used to access the single keyword entry facility. If CTRL+SHIFT+@ are pressed simultaneously, lower case is available.\nThere are two display connections on the Rabbit, one composite for a monitor, the other RF output for television. The text display is 40x24 characters and the graphic display offers a 256x192 pixels resolution. The main drawback with the display is the screen scroll. This, apart from being dreadfully slow, copies lines from various parts of the rest of the screen and briefly flashes them at other places, notably the bottom line.\nThe sales brochure specifies that 16 colors are available, but it's rather 8 colors with a brightness option. INK, PAPER and BORDER instructions are used to change the display colors accordingly.\nIt's possible to mix text and graphics with several lines at the bottom of the screen on which to display text. The SPRITE command allow sprites to be placed on screen after they have been set up with PATTERN. Once placed, any of the 32 available sprites can be moved with the MOVE command. This automatically deletes the sprite from its current location and redisplays it at the new relative position specified in the MOVE command.\nRabbit announced data storage option called the Datasafe memory, offering 8Kb semi-permanent RAM storage which can be used to store data after the machine has been switched off.\nAnother option for saving data is the disk drive, which was also announced (but never released ?). Four of these drives could be connected, each having a 640 Kb storage capacity.\nThe Wrap Bit II was supposed to be released in different versions: 48 Kb, 80 Kb or 144 Kb RAM.\nThe sales brochure announces that the Wrap Bit II is Colecovision compatible through an optional adapter which maybe was never released... CP\/M is also an option though the computer would need 80 columns interface + the disk drives. Not sure either if these have ever been released...",

        "description": "The Fujitsu FM-X is one of the first MSX models to be released, and the only MSX computer ever made by Fujitsu. Indeed Fujitsu had another competing computer range which was quite successful, in the form of the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=325\">FM-7<\/a>, <a href=\"computer.asp?c=377\">FM-8<\/a> and <a href=\"computer.asp?c=373\">FM-77<\/a>, and which were based on a Motorola 6809 processor. Thus Fujitsu didn't really insist in producing other MSX models.\nThe FM-X has only 16 KB of RAM, 1 cartridge port and no printer interface. It's a very minimal version of a MSX computer.\nHopefully by inserting the Fujitsu MB22451 cartridge in the 60-pin expansion slot, you get an additional 16KB RAM and a printer interface.\nWith the Fujitsu MB22450 expansion package, you could something crazy: connect the FM-X to the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=32\">FM-7<\/a> so that each computer can benefit from each other features !! For example, the FM-X can thus use 32 KB RAM from the FM-7, or the optional FM sound chip, or the printer, or the RS-232C card, or use its keyboard or even use the FM-7 monitor to view\/modify the content of the memory, etc. Crazy I told you! \nIn the opposite direction, the FM-7 could use the PSG channels of the FM-X, or its connected joysticks.\nAlthough the FM-X has a standard Texas Instruments TMS9928ANL VDP, the RGB colors are different because an additional circuit reworks the palette to be the same as used on the Fujitsu FM-7. It's encoded in 3-bit RGB, reducing the palette from 16 colors to 8 colors.\n<font color=\"#666666\">\n____\nThanks to Generation-msx.nl for the picture and to MSX.org for some of the info !<\/font>",

These systems can support up to 20 users.\nThe System 2800 uses and 8 bit Z80A processor running at 4 MHz. The basic system is supplied with 128 Kb of paged RAM, which may be expanded in multi-user applications to a total of 512 Kb. The processor supports eight vectored prioritised interrupts and a real time clock.\nThe basic system is supplied with four RS232C compatible ports, operating a up to 38,4 K baud. A synchonous option is available with a maximum transmission rate of 614.4 K baud, the baud rates being software selectable. The machines also include a 16 bit bidirectionnal parallel port whih, with the addition of the appropriate \"personality\" board, may support Centronics compatible printers. The use of eight slot S100 bus means that a number of slots are available for expansion.\n<b>PERIPHERALS<\/b>\nThe models in the range are available with a choice of floppy and hard disk units. The floppy disk drives are either single or double density giving formatted storage capacities of either 600 Kb or 1.02 Mb. The 5.25 inches Winchester hard disks give formatted capacities of between 10 and 31.5 Mb, whilst the 8 inches hard disks are available with storage capacities of 20 Mb.\nThe basic model (2860) incorporates one floppy disk drive and one 10 Mb Winchester hard disk. The most advanced model (2866\/2) is supplied with two floppy disk drives, a pair of 16.5 Mb Winchester hard disks and an 11 Mb taped drive.\nThese systems support standard RS232C \/ Centronices compatible printers.\n<b>SOFTWARE<\/b>\nIn single user applications the System 2800 computers rune under CP\/M 2.2.

It looks like a mini-computer with a fairly big case that can house mutimple user boards. Each user has a dedicated Z80A-base-single board that fits into the system mainframe.\nThe modular, stackable system can expand up to 64 users. To add a user, you need a dumb terminal and a user \"microcomputer\" module added into the mainframe.\nThe Zeus computer use modular hard disk storage giving a capacity from 34 Mb to 600 Mb. It also features tape backup and shared printers with spooling and queuing.\nOne singularity of the Zeus is that it is equiped with a battery\/recharger system that provides up to 20 minutes of operating power in case of power failures, lightning ot voltage variations.\nZeus uses MUSE as its operating system, a CP\/M compatible OS for multi-user computers.\nOne difference between OSM's approach and that of other manufacturers is that OSM does not require the individual CPU\/memory cards to share the same S100 bus. The OSM design approximates that of a local network, in that the only real connection between the users is a data bus carrying information to and from the master CPU, which handles the disk chores.\nOSM also differs from some of the other multi-user systems in that each user's CPU\/memory combination also includes terminal and printer I\/O. Thus, except for the disk drive, each user has a complete computer system responding to his commands, and the only contention among users is the disk drive itself. OSM resolves this problem by providing 32Kb of memory for the master processor, which acts as a buffer between user requests and the disk drive.",

        "description": "OSM Computer Corporation, based in Santa Clara California, produced several multi-user CP\/M computers called Zeus.\nThe Zeus 3X was released in 1983, and is a natural follow-up of previous systems: <a href=\"computer.asp?c=1334\">Zeus, Zeus II, Zeus 3. The Zeus 3X was available as the same time as the <\/a><a href=\"computer.asp?c=1336\">Zeus 4<\/a>, in which it differs in some features (more users, more memory, tape drive, real time clock, etc.) making it more suited for larger companies. \nThe OSM Zeus 3X is a Z80 based multi-user computer that supports a single hard drive (from 12 to 140 Mb) and up to 32 users (8 only for the Zeus 4) via dumb terminals plugged into RS232 ports. The ports supports several terminal emulations as well as serial printers and modems.\n<br the zeus is also equipped with a tape cartridge backup unit offering storage capacity of mb. it real time clock optional on>\nThe Zeus computer uses MUSE (Multi User System Executive) as its operating system, a CP\/M compatible OS for multi-user computers from OSM. It incorporates all the standard features of CP\/M, while adding file management capabilities such as multi-user file sharing, password protection, print spooling, data security and auto-searching. Later, the ZMOS operating system, another multi-user CP\/M compatible OS, was also available.\nIn the november 1984's issue of Computerworld, there is an article describing how Pepsi bought and used Zeus 3X computers to help them cope with orders processing through these multi-user file sharing systems.",

        "description": "In 1978, Smoke Signal Chieftain Computers (SSCC) released their first computer: The Chieftain, followed in 1980 by the Chieftain Business System, an update to the original Chieftain.\nAt the start of 1982, the company introduced the Chieftain 9822, an update to the Business System featuring the same processor and static RAM options, as well as the same nine-slot bus equipped with the first two Chieftains.\nThe system could be equipped with either two 8-inch or two 5.25-inch floppy drives and Winchester hadr drives with a capacity between 4 MB to 60 MB. This Chieftain spanned two units: one for the disk drives, the other for the processor, memory, and disk controller.\nPurchasers could choose either an updated version of DOS-68 for the Motorola 6809?its name now shortened to Smoke Signal DOS?or Microware's multi-tasking, multi-user, \"Unix-comparable\" operating system, OS-9. Smoke Signal DOS was free of charge, while OS-9 cost an additional US$195. A system configured with Smoke Signal's choice of dumb terminal and printer cost around US$8149. The Chieftain's two units could be mounted under a desk or stacked on top of each other.\nHere are some configurations advertised in april 1982:\n- The Chieftain 95W4: 4 MB hard disk + 360 KB 5.25'' floppy disk drive\n- The Chieftain 98W15: 15 MB hard disk + 1 MB 8'' floppy disk drive\n- The Chieftain 95XW4: 4 MB hard disk + 750 KB octo-density floppy disk drive\n- The Chieftain 9W15T20: 15 MB hard disk + 20 MB tape streamer",

        "description": "The W86 is a french computer released in 1983 by Welect. It's the second computer released by Welect after the <a href=\"computer.asp?c=256\">W80.2<\/a>.\nThe W86 is powered by an Intel 8086 (hence its name) to catch up with the IBM PC compatible trend of the moment and is thus able to run MS-DOS. But the W86\nis also equipped with a Z80A to also be CP\/M compatible. It's thus an hybrid machine typical of the mid-80s when the professional industry was moving from CP\/M to MS-DOS.\nThere is 128 KB RAM available that can be expanded up to 1 MB. The two built-in 8'' floppy drives (double sided, double density) can store 1 MB each, for a total of 2 MB data storage.\nThe display features are basic with a 24x80 text resolution. Semi-graphics and blinking characters are in option. The monitor is monochrome (green phosphor).\nThe Welect W86 apparently had no success as it is very difficult to find a specimen nowadays. Its exaggerated price (65 230 FF in June 1983) must have prevented a lot people from buying one. But Welect was used to have big french companies as clients, often nationalized ones (PTT, INSEE, M?t?orologie Nationale, Charbonnage de France, Renault, ?ducation Nationale, Minist?re des ?quipements et des Transports, etc). They thought that they could continue to sell them average systems to a very high price, which was apparently not the case...",
